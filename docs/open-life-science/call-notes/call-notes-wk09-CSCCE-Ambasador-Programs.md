 - Advocacy ninja's did the thing I wanted to do - surveyed ambassador programs

%** These slides are going to be great for WIN

## Ambassador Programs - Intro

 - empower community members to move forward t=the community's mission.
 - help us to scale. Moving from initial inception phase into community growth.
 - formal engagement structures for the most dedicated members (super users)

 - Make sure you've got materials in place for your ambassadors form the beginning (needs to be a positive experience from the outset), but doesn't need to be perfect. %** I'll probably need to draft the material for the website.

 - Ambasadors help with legitimacy. May receive more frank feedback. Have to empower ambassadors to speak with appreciate language
 - Need to create feedback channels for them to report back.

 - Can help with reach into parts of the community team you can't get to. Might need to contextualise the material. Also set scope of reach.

 - Great way of sourcing content
 - Feel valued
 - Pilot initiatives



## Presentation 1: What do scientific ambassador programs look like

"Ambasadors, Champions, Fellows and More"


This data is going to be great evidence about why the ambassador program is a good thing to focus on. Also what recruitment and incentives work!! <3

 - Have stats on budget and size <3

 - Most ambassadors asked to comment on "open ended rolling basis"

Recruitment majority by formal application form. Some selective, some mildly selective (e.g. on 75% accepted).

Participation tracking through self report surveys (like, "How many people have you helped?"). Some had no formal tracking. Maybe problematic for checking success.

Incentives:
 - Top cited (most frequent) was public recognition (e.g. post, public announcement). Least cited was monetary reward.
 - Big success factor is personal growth of participants.

Age:
 - Older programs tended to be larger and have bigest budgets

 - Newer programs had most incentives. Inc only 3 with money which were the newest.

Budget:
- large budgets associated with formal marketing campaigns

Size:
- Small programs have unique terms of commitment
- Size and resources are correlated.

Names:

- "Fellows" are best supported and most selective
- The word "advocates" is plotically charged

Survey is online and all the data %**



## Presentation 2: What motivates the participants in ambassador programs?

What makes ambasadors get involved?
Why people contribute to communities?

Community: "A group of people shaing a common interest of goal who communicate and work toghether through a shared platform"

Contributuioins are active (e.g. not just being a member of the mailing list)

How do people contribute?
- mostly by sharing within their community - outreach or disemination.
- Most comonly contribute >6h per month (e.g. one day) or <2h per month %**
- For many these contributions overlap with their day job, so not really additionanl work. **

Motivations:
- Social (Meet like minded peopl) and congnitive (finding out information).
- Some are particularly mission focused, e.g. to deliver training

How are they feeling?
- Many strongly agree with mission of community and feeel well supported by the community manager
- Some feel their contributions make a differeence.
- 52% identified factors which discourage contribution
- Most (67%) discouraged by too many demands on tier time. These are volunteers and they habe a busy worklife already.
- %**Biggest missing support is financial. They are not being paid for it. The are volunteers. Maybe we could think about buy-out...?**

Do they benefit from having a named role?
- Having a named role (within and as a part of the program) both does and doesn't make a difference - If you had one you valued it, if you sidn't you didn't think you would bebefit from one.

%**Lot of data left to analyse. Contact Lou to pick up**".

How do programs evolve?
- they change very quickly as change happens.
- Ambassadors doing pick-and-mix functions - some do A, some do A, B and C.

**Size per n. community managers**
- When it's new, you have to do a lot of hand holding.
- Open Leaders started started with 6 or 10 people.
- Start small but a meaningful number.

How do we not overstreatch ambasadors?
- Concern about academic vulnerability to burnout. They feel like they owe people. Are we propogating something in the existing culture that we don't wnat?
- Small asks and big asks: The role that we play ahs the potential to take advantage of people.
- Some communities handle this well - allowing variable and changes in commitment (as per time allowed) for individuals.
- Not our responisbility to protect but it is our responsibility to look out for it and communicate that you are welcome back.
- Turnover / resentment if the commitment required doesn't match the initial descrption or expectation.
- %**Output as tangable products which can go on CV, e.g. "participanted in Policy day"**
- %**Get ambassadors to write "job descriptions" when they have some experience. **

Name of the brand gives them legitamacy to ECRs

How do you time the launch of an ambasadors program?
 - %**Pajau sounds like she's doing something similar to me, at Birkley**
 - Is there a need within the community which you could leverage for the launch of the community?
