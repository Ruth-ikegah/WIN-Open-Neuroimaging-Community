Group call notes: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YF3Uw-fU2-mhf-FyuPdx07KSTSlvnBZeMbQdQGJq4A4/edit#

Breakout room:
What’s a place that made you feel included the first time you visited? (online or in-person)
- TEDANA call
What made that place so inclusive?
- Invited into the discussion
- How people behaved to each other. Some community members (traditioanlly the most senior) should embody the behaviours.
Shared Insights on the implicit bias test?

## Unconscious Bias & Designing for inclusion

### Inclusion can't be an after thought
Diversity = inviting lots of people to the party
Inclusion = making more people feel welcome (e.g. having lots of different types of drinks) so people feel able to contribute.

Unconscious bias
- "Unconscious bias" as a term has a negative stigma. Makes it difficult for people to approach.
- Remember it is just learnt pattern matching. Sometimes it can have unintended consequences.
- Algorithms internalise and exacerbate our baises.

Inclusion has to be part of our design process
 - examples: crash test dummies; git commit history assumes names never change.
 - We get more inclusive when we spot our previously unnoticed rules.
 - We exclude when we internalise rules that exclude others.
 - We get more inclusive by widening our world-view. We wont recognise a rule as 'bad' until we have a counter example.

 - Who are some traditionally represented people who are doing some good work on inlusion who can help me see that they have good things to contribute in this area?

## Community Engagements & Interactions
Speaker: Malvika
### Community engeeagement
All members have equal opportunity to engage
#### Mountine of engegement
 - Discover how people interact with your community
1) Lisy of all peoples interactiosn with your work
2) bands/levels of engagement
3) Group into bands
4) Identify what works/what doesn't work
5) Prioritise where to make more opportunities.

What makes it easy for someone to move up (engage more) if they want to?
%**Go through these slides more carefully. This is a nice exercise. Could start by looking at the engagement that Verena has already done. **

What do you want to communicate to your community?

### Community interactions
1) Gifting
2) Creating together
3) Soliciting ideas
4) LEarning through use
5) Networking comming interests.

## Personas & Pathways
Speaker: Kirstie Whitaker

You don't have to just copy what people define as success.

What will participantion in your project do for your contributors?
 - What are you in control of? What can you deliver for them?
 - What can we do for them?
 - What can we build to gether that we could not do appart?

%**Governance**
 - decision making, delegating, devolving

### Persona
- Useful when having conversations with people about your project
- Based on real world observations
%**1) Name, age, identifying details
2) Skills, levelt of knowlegde, expereince
3) Needs, motivations, barriers**
- be mindful of putting your own expereince on every persona!

### Pathway
How are people going to join. your open project?
1) Discovery
2) First Contact
3) Participation
4) Sustatined participation
5) Networked Participatiosn - they bring in other people/resources/communities
6) Leadership

%**All of this is going to be good for working on in building Open-WIN community**

Mentored issues:
 - Writing really good, accessible issues is hard.
 - Ask people to flag if they are willing to mentor, and "good first issues" to work on.

Rather than completing the task for someone, try to soliciit the barriers which are stopping them from finishing.

%**Like the mentored issues thing*

### Ongong support
 - What will people need form you in order to stick around?

"really important and helpful to identify who a new participant should talk with directly when they first contribute. It can be difficult to know who is the point person on a particular part of a project! Yo: +1! I’ll often add a line something like: “What to do if you need help - mention @yochannah, email or drop by our chat” - I used GitHub Saved Replies for this"



## Breakout
What kinds of things do you give to others in your open leadership practices?
- development opportunities, skills enhancing
What kinds of things do you get back?
- development opportunities
Does the balance seem right to you, or are there adjustments you’d like to make?
- Putting too much work on other people right now.
- Be clear on the expectations
