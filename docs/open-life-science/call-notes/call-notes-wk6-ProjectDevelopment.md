# Project development

Rachel Ainsworth runs the collaborations workshop - great contact.

Next two weeks are development and dissemination.

## Agile and iterative project management

Agile: Post-it notes everywhere.

Core values - favouring flexibility and interactions with people over strict behaviours. Pushing back against linear waterfall, which doesn't leave room for specifications to change. In agile small discrete chunks are released and fed-back.

In our projects we have large milestones, but also smaller tasks within those. ⭐️ Smaller tasks should be 1-2h or 1-2 day. These sizes are easier to estimate. Things which are further away are harder  to estimate. Closer it is, the more granular it should be.

❓Can we link trello with GitHub? Looks to be possible with [power up](https://trello.com/power-ups/55a5d916446f517774210004/github).

## Open hardware

Speaker: Julieta Arancio, Open Hardware Leaders (Contact: @cassandreces, jarancio@unsam.edu.ar) ⭐️ Contact for OHBM symposium. PhD is about how open hardware is enabling research.

Most of the tools we use - the designs of that hardware is only available to the vendor. If we do not fully understand how the data are acquired, it is is black box. Causes problems when the equipment break down. More difficult in countries which are far away from the centres where tools are produced. Also makes them difficult to customise. ⭐️ Access to equipment is the biggest cause for differences in data production in Global South vs Global North.

People have been making tools. 3D printing has helped change this. If you need it, someone has probably started making it.

People have reservations about data quality. But you can publish in Nature with open hardware.

Important part of reproducibility conversation - cannot reproduce if cannot collect the same

⭐️ 90% reduction of cost in equipment when Hardware - Joshua Pearce - The Open Source Lab. Some papers too. Most of the economic cost reduction is about things which can be 3D printed.

❓Open source super computers?

⭐️Christine Rogers going to Cuba to work on open source EEG.

## Open Source Software

Speaker: Andrew Stewart, University of Manchester

Remember that we would never use someone else's research findings without citing them, so we should be thinking the same way about software, particularly as RSEs are also measured on citations rate.

Open helps with reproducibility. Closed could only be reproducible by people who have access to the same tools as was used to create.

⭐️Andrew thinks there is a computational skills gap which is potentially getting wider. We should be supporting adoption of new tools to close the gap.

Question about who is going to review peoples software etc - For Andrew, he's started saying "No" to other stuff. Yo Edited for JOSS - if software and documentation was really good quality, the review was really quick. ⭐️ We could consider signing up for the review pool.

## Relevance of these topics into our own projects

* Iterative project management
* What are my milestones?

⭐️Aidan's tip on milestones - try to focus on what's next (small tasks), and leave the detail on more general later / larger milestones to evolve as they get nearer.

⭐️⭐️ Malvika: Start with something where you can get most feedback from people. What can you create where you feel most accomplished.

## Open data

Lilly Winfree, OKFN lilly.winfree@okfn.org / @lilscientista

FAIR was originated at FORCE11.

The PI is the "steward" of the data.

You can work with a journal to discuss copy-write of data. Do not have to automatically give over.

Facts are not copyrightable, but works of authorship are. ⭐️University of California Curation Centre.

Help make this are more defined by licensing your data.

Questions to ask to choose your license:
1. What do you want to do with the data?
2. What do you want others to be able to do with the data?
3. Who can use this data (e.g. only non-profit)?
4. Do you want to be attributed.

### Data management plans

Usually written before data collection, often required by funders. A lot of energy towards making data more FAIR.

### Publishing your Data

Record the metadata!! Data dictionaries. What do the column names mean? What are the units?

⭐️ What metadata are being required for WIN Open database?

⭐️ A single licence for each data source (e.g. in WIN Open db) might not be suitable as cannot expect users to check the licence for each data set. ⭐️ Do we need to decide a suitable licence for all datasets in the db?
