# Career paths and ally skills

## Open Science career paths
Speaker: Malvika

### Academic Group Leader
Speaker: Fotis Psomopoulos (Group Leader)

Project leaders help "turn ideas into action"
- Leadership and learning are indisipensible to each other
- A leader leads, and the boss drives
- Leadership is the art of accomplishing more that the science of managment says is possible - enable people to work with you rather than under you.

Skills:
- Communication
- Flexibly deal with ambiguoity
- Work well with the team
- motivation to lead the project and person
- Stress management - yourself and your team
- Team building

Three 'A's
- Accountibility - who is responsible and what actions can they take? Do not make someone accountable for something which is out of their control
- Authority - take the lead and move forward
- Autonomy - The desire to move without direct supervision. For yourself and your team. Autonomy helps your team grow.

Cultivate leadership attributes
- Curiosity - learning - you need to be interested in the thing.
- Integrity - know yourself (your weaknessess) and follow up. Be a role model
- Listening - Everyone has a different way of communicating, so you have to know how to listen in diferent wyas.

Effective delegation
- micromanaging shows that you don't have confidence in your teams skills. Also means they don't have the autonomy to learn.

Providing Feedback
- Criticize privately
- Praise publicly

### Post-academic career paths
Speaker: Beth Duckles
Book: Openpostac.org

"Post Ac" - Post-Academics

Networks matter. You need "weak ties" to people to make things happen. Make the weak ties with people who interest you.

Help people solve problems.

Develop and attitute of imperfect action rather than inaction.
What has inction cost you?

### Leadership in training and education
Speaker: Jason Williams,  Assistant Director, Cold Spring Harbor DNALC, founder LifeSciTrainer

Create the opportunities you are looking for
Take the opportunities
Understand people

People listen to good ideas. It may not strike gold the first time you raise it. If you have the audacity to raise it, do.

There may be opportunities which don't seem to create a lot of value at first, but saying yes can bring new connections and friendships which are more valuable than the project on paper. Take oportunities when people give you a chance to help them.

Cultivate empathy for other people, particularly your team. The difference between excellent and good scientists are networking and communicating.

Be unappologetic about what you need (self care).

## Sustaining
 Breakout:
- What brought you to your work and to open leadership?
- What would you need to keep doing this work for another 5 years?
- What would you need to keep doing this work for the rest of your career?


**Open Leadership is a thing**
You can increase the effectiveness of your leadership through open leadership - work with rather for.

What brought us here - our values.

Sharing the vision and the mission

**Call with Chiara about getting into community work - Maybe on CSCCE**

### Self care
Speaker: Yo

Fulfilling days
- progressing students
- exciting interactions

Unfulfillling days
- brick walls

Promote the things that are working well for you.

**Selfcare needs to be proactive - "If I do this, I will need to watch out for..."**

**In communities, demo and model that you are "well". Then make space and enable others to do the same. **

What brings you delight? Bring more of that in.
