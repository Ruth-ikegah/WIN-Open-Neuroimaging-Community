Call with Naomi 17/03/20

Discussed issues around identifying and setting priorities (also first week of CV self isolation)

There are a number of areas which I 'd love to feed into in the WIN project. But where to start? Is there evidence that WIN will listen to my (the communities') arguments?

Remember this is a change management process

What are my priorities?

Starting a new job well
 - small things that are achievable, so you can prove to people that you can do things well.
 - what things do they WIN management want to see?

 - REF stuff
 - Money
 - Wellcome and funders
 - What does the external review board want to see?

Finding out what people what to see could be an exercise to generate a roadmap.
 - Show what can be done and what the path forward is

People to speak to:
- Wellcome program officer and Wellcome policy team;
- Rainer etc about why they thought the original plan was unrealistic/unachievable.
- look for low hanging fruit which demonstrates it is possible to improve practices (the work I want to do is possible and has impact) and that work leads to better science and can get more funding.

Direct measurable in PI's time sharing stim code.
 - Time or effort saved for PIs. How many queries did they field in sharing stim. How much time/effort does that take for their team to support?
 - Process for stimulus documentation. I do it first, holding the hand of the lab member to get started, then create a process for going forward


Librarians:
 - Rosie Higman. Marta Teporic (worked with Rosie) (started research data champions in Cambridge) - contact for strategies on institutional change.

**OBJECTIVE: What do they want?**

Book: The First 90 days

Dinner after a conference. What purpose does it fulfil?
- tired, de-brief, drop in and out of, reflection, giggle.
- How do we engineer this in virtual meetings?
