## Giving Feedback

We use the 2x2 paradigm for feedback.
- Positive Content and Negative Content
- Positive Delivery and Negative Delivery
- Here is the suggested Rubric for Demonstrations ([from the carpentries Instructor Training](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/demos_rubric/) )
- How can we be constructive. How could this be useful for someone. What could be improved.


Positive and negative feedback is important for loads of reasons. Really nice thgouths on the [call notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PG3jXV1A9OjFR1EEZ0rNafbD-oJdp3R4rGL2VzPbAaA/edit#)

Ask people if they are ready for feedback or would like it.



My feedback:
- Cut out two minutes!! Probably cut out some of what WIN have done (e.g. poor repo)
- Go full screen. 
- Use a timer
