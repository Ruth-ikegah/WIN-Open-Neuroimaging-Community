Managing expectations of what I'm going to do first, so I can deliver in them.

To clear my space so I can do these meaningful things, I need these other things taken care of.

Call with Naomi, 05/05/20

Pretend I'm the sort of person with boundaries and can set expectations in meeting with Clare.

What does the online version of my hacks look like?

Get people to start a journey with you.

Work out the loop holes with the people who are available. Maybe some testing in the next 3-6 months.

Do user research in this time. To get to know people. Persona development.

Double all my own timelines.

What matters to me is my reputation
