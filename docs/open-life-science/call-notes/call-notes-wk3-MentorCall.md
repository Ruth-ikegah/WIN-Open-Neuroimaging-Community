# Week 1 (to be done in Week 3)
## Roll call
Cass Gould van Praag
Naomi Penfold

## Agenda

Homework before the call, Project Lead (mentee) will:
Take a Self-Assessment SURVEY and share the outcome with their mentors during the call.
 [Link to your notes from the survey outcome]
Set 1-2 personal open science goals for yourself.




What do you want to see from a mentor?




Notes during the call:

## Introductions - get to know each other

Important person: LM, Nicola(?) → clearly opportunities now they’ve built the policies/infra, but feels lack of understanding of what “community” really means (not just training!)

Has spoken with Malvika and Aidan → community is more formal than her job right now

Image Centre review in November is important milestone/deadline -- they need to see adoption

Needs to write JD! Connect to Lou Woodley re what community really involves!

Training wheel: help the community to write them

OLS project: appreciates the structure of talking through with someone.

About Cass:
looking for a similar person for a comfortable situ
short hair love!
Also cares about events
Chairing open science corner of a meeting (end of June; Kirstie W is past chair of this SIG for MNI) - wants it to be amazing! Recognises people aren’t always comfortable with networking.
Best event? Wedding - packed w logistics, self-made! Amazing to help people enjoy themselves & make sure they’re ok.
Appreciates how Kirstie helped her w/ challenging senior/status quo, intro to open science, role modelling, github etc
Concerned re people using github: some ppl are scared (thinking about Turing Way)
About Naomi:
Screenshot of my intro to the eLife Ambassadors:
TBD
Intentions: learn how to mentor instead of try to always suggest solutions / be hypercritical.


Done -- Mentees, tell your mentor about your project
Self-assessment framework
Difficult to answer as a frequency, more of a confidence
Key strengths Cass is empowered with:
Storytelling -- confident
Sharing -- very strong, good experiences, might overshare
Her own imaging notes shared → became a big resource & project for others
Q: How much is needed to start something for others to follow?
Open Science calendar hackathon -- had a script to start with, demo’d it, others came along & offered help “wouldn’t it be cool if…”, → the power of starting & showing something
Seeding activity
Giving people ownership of things / delegating -- something fun they’re interested in -- doesn’t feel protective of things
Co-creation aspect of her project
Inclusion work -- valuable to align people, making space for people
Areas Cass might need help with:
>>
How does this relate to the project?
Politics -- worried about the status quo, establishment rules (and not knowing a rule), less about convincing
Inhibited by knowing the rules, intimidation! Better not to know?
When interacting,
Hope they leave with: an open mind, take her seriously, understand the intention is to have a conversation not to impose
Fear they leave with: impression they’re being told to do something completely differently by someone they’re different to
This sounds like organisational change management
Helped: when others are onside and can answer Qs too, not the only advocate
Concern: find resources in an audio format, doesn’t want to take on too much extra reading
Tangible starting points for co-created policymaking?
Career development review (departmental): currently a space for recognising public engagement work but no space for recognising open science work
OLS goal: add this space
Community work (job) goal: open science ambassadors -- goal: one point-person per lab for their peers’ questions -- requirements: training, communications, etc
Timeline: next review is next year
Learning objective for Cass: understand what is realistic & achievable? Beware time sinks or understand the scale of things
Scaling down: start a convo with the prospective ambassadors as to how this would help them? What are my assumptions?
Assumptions: want to be paid, want effort to be counted, acknowledgement it detracts from paper-writing, ok spending time on others & not individual progress

Key concern: new job role politics: Oxford Neuro (3 brain & 2 wider-body depts) → how to develop policy across all departments? How to set up communications with them all?


Set 1-2 overall goals for your project
Where do you want your project to be by the end of the program? (15 weeks)
Possible areas to think about:
Community: Contributors / Maintainers / Members
Product (Launch / MVP / Feature)
Resources / Sustainability (Governance / Funding / Gifts)
Mentees will discuss your notes from your homework
Meeting logistics & Reminders
Does this time every 2 weeks work for everyone?


Full cohort call next week (see Syllabus for details: https://openlifesci.org/ols-1)
Assignments after this call
Create a repo in GitHub for your work (if you don’t have one already) and share the link to your mentor.
Draft a brief vision statement using your goals. This lesson from the Open Leadership Training Series (OLTS) might be helpful.
You might address:
The problem you’re trying to solve.
How you think openness and open leadership will help solve it.
How meeting your personal goals will help you and help solve the problem.
How meeting your cultural goals for your community, organization, or project will help solve the problem.
Add your vision statement to your repo by uploading it or copy and pasting it into your README document.
Anything else?
Can we get clear deliverables in a roadmap for the OLS 15 weeks?
Online space where Cass can start things & invite others to contribute
Starting point: 1 departmental gitlab
End point: somewhere she feels is really suitable & people are happy with, not siloed, all departments
Meeting logistics
Mon/Tues -- good for working on this after 5pm → Tuesdays, 6-6:30pm, Cass’s zoom

Next time
Can we get clear deliverables in a roadmap for the OLS 15 weeks?

After: Naomi’s suggestions for resources/connections that might help

Writing your job description: Lou Woodley (CSCCE) re what being a Community Manager really involves. Would you like to be connected to her to discuss? (She tends to be very willing to have a chat about this!)
Change management, or managing the politics of entering the ‘establishment’ space & starting a convo about changing the way things are done:
**requires an account to watch beyond 5 mins :(**A 10-minute video (a bit American and corporate-y; audio is sufficient, video not needed): https://study.com/academy/lesson/kotters-8-step-change-model-of-management.html ← Kotter’s 8 steps resonate with me, but...
I’d love to know if there’s a more feminist model to listen to! Maybe we can both ask around?
