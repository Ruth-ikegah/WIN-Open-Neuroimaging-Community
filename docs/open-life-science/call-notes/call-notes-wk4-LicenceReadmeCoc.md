Licensing


 - Take the time to think about things like licensing so you can build open.

 - "Open Source" just speaks to licensing.
 - May have open licence but not be interested in collaborating

 - Open governance...?

 - License bring right and responsibilities

 - About screen in software often the place to give attribution to the elements it includes

 - Permissive ("non-reciprocal") licence (e.g. MIT) don't require derivative works to be shared with the same license

 - Copyleft ("reciprocal") requires all derivative works to be shared with the same license

 - Look at the licences that are common in the communityy you are releSING TO

 - Respon suabilityies kick in at distribution

 - With copy left licensing, responsibilities kick in as soon as make derivative

 - What are you distributing and what are you deriving your works from

 - opensource.guid good resource for community building and governance

Readme

 - They teach how to write a readme!! Should be the first thing you write.

 - empower others to collaborate

 - It is the doormat - first thing they see.

 - doesn't have to be an actual file, could be the landing page of the website.

 - what you're doing, for who and why. - What makes your project special
 - list the resources (e.g. license, CoC)
 - [STEM Role Models](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels) is a good example

 - Communication expectations about readiness

 - Badges... e.g. doi

 - emoji's to make it less dry... Difficult to express friendliness

 - can also use animated gifs of demos. Make sure there is also a text description

(Remember that the open paradigms people need to

 - Community is all about relationships

Contribution guidelines and code of conduct


 - What kind of culture do you want you want your project to have
 - conscious choices
  - values
 - how to interact

 - Culture is language, shared norms, tools, systems identified. All effect health and progress of the project

 - contributors are people with their own world view and own stories.
 - People should want to contribute to your project

 - check carpentries for good example

 - processes and conventions people need to follow and how they are expected to interact with other members of the community

 - writing and maintain this file will help you sort out how to have good interactions in your community

 - List of communication channels into the project

 - CoC tells people that their wellbeing is important in your project.

 - Examples TransHak CoC

 - Welcome
 - Set expectations, inc "not doing so will have consequences"
 - Behaviours we encourage
 - Have to enforce. If don't enforce you are signalling that you actively don't care

 - How will we processionals an incident or complaint

 - Encourage and reward good practice
 - Craft with your community for buy-in
 - Designate a CoC and Safety committee
 - make sure it is posted and clear
 - Use an existing CoC

 - Culture will build itself unless you do it actively.




 - Any code of conduct is not a policy, it is only a suggestion.

 - guiding light is desire to protect your community. What are the consequences of not acting on behaviour. Consequence has to be proportional to the behaviour.


 - Need to think carefully about and consult with relevant parties on what matters can be dealt with “in house” and what needs to be escalated to WIN (or department).
 - Excluding somebody from something when it is their work portfolio is problematic. - Speak to Carinne about this.
 - What is in the communities responsibility and what should be pushed up to management
