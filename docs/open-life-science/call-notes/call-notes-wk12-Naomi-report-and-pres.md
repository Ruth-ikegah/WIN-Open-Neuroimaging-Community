Planning
Being open form the start
Producing something that helps you carry on - progress and celebration

Key learning moments
 - developed vocabulary to work out what I do and appreciate it. Also vocabulary to call out non-inclusive practices.
 - quote from Stephan re: decisions made behind close doors are the source of all things terrible - value system
 - Open science to open leader - how aligned they were - I've gone one way and others have gone the other.
 - Empowered to practice in this way - clarity and validation
 - Prepping me to do a job
 - Output is I'm ready to go into the job!
 - Flesh out: The bits i've learnt, the bits I like, the bits I don't want to do (show how I have used the curriculum.

 - How can I help myself with the mind the gap exercise? An exercise the other OLS people.
 - Pressure to be perfect humans in the open leaders. It's ok to make mistakes.
 - By being an open leader, you're trying to build a team around you. How do you find the right middle ground to do enough work but leave enough space for other people?

Project management
- Not in my job description
- Don't want it to be a voluntary add on to work load.
- rotating role.

- It's ok that it's changed.
