# Mozilla [Movement-building from home] Week 4

Online space which you have felt really wellcome

- Understanding the explicit rules of engagement. No assumption that I know the norms-practies makes it easy for others to join.
- %**Silent documenting is a great way for everyone to share their views**

Onboarding ideads:
- Integrating new members into weekly meetings before they start, ask them to share things they’ve been doing, whether it is related to work of team or not - do this in a group way so the new folks aren’t the only person sharing.
- %**digital edition of a hackathon and used a 1-2-4-all format for ideation “didaktische doppeldecker” effect of both creating intimacy for relationship-building as well as helping ideation.**

Long silences are good. 10 seconds.
Keeping calls on time.

- How might you apply something like the Mountain of Engagement to your community?
- 	Think I'm going to be doing lots of researching. It's going to be a good framework
- 	Open Space technology & Art of Hosting technology. Participants develope agenda, vote on pitches, harvesting time (tree of harvesting), open reflection.
- What new approaches to community management are you learning right now? Are there any you can imagine continuing after the immediate crisis passes?
- 	We work across three sites, with lots of issues about moving. Think it will be good to have online meetings. Inclusive design helps everyone :).
- How are you planning to stay connected with new allies and community members?
- 	?

- %**newcomer-welcome message template from Storytellers United that a) says hello to new community members who have joined in the last 2 weeks and b) links to a pinned message of 5 first steps to take to explore the server and its channels.**
