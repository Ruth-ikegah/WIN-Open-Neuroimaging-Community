Share mission and vision:

I’m working with 225 research groups across Oxford Neuroscience to create a community of open and inclusive researchers so that we can develop the policies, governance and structures we would like in place to support us in practicing open science.

I’m working open because I believe this is the most effective way to deliver justice oriented science.


Open Canvas

 - Open canvas fill in: bit.ly/ols-open-canvas
 - Think about metrics for my project success
 - Resources: who do I need to speak to?
 - People who are contributing are people who can help you get your resources
 - Who is your target audience. Who will be your early adopters.
 - How might we get new contributors and users

 - Doing this helps you think critically about your project and in ways you might not have done.


 - What am I offering to the world which is useful and interesting. What you offer and why you are different.

 - Review example open canvas


Open roadmap

 - Empower others to collaborate in inclusive communities

 - How you design your project to help participation and inclusion

 - Welcome space to show contributors they are in the right place.
 - You need to let them know what his login on
 - what is your vision

1) Project summary and welcome

2) How to get involved

3) Timeline & milestones, and tasks to achieve milestones. Relate to your vision.


How to share roadmap?
 - ROADMAP.md on github
 - A README.md with roadmap inside?
 - An issue with tick boxes
 - Project tab in GitHub?


 - Is gitlab the best place to host this project? Already open-imaging group. Would be good to keep attention of tech people. Keeps version control and transparency. Good opportunity to train people on git.
 - Do we have "projects" tab in gitlab? Can they make one? Below “Issues” tab. Is that the same?
