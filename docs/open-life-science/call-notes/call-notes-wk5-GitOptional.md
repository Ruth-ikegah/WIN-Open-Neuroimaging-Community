# What is a collaborative document

What problems do we encounter with collab docs?
* asyncronous editing
* conflicting editing
* location/timezone differences which make it hard to communcate
* Versions

⭐️ This is all going to be good for Oxford - Berlin School - I've volunteered to run session on open collaborative projects on github. Slides from Mozilla. And WIN Hacks.
