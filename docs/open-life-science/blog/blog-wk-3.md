## Week 3
First call with Naomi. ‚ö†Ô∏è[notes will go here]‚ö†Ô∏è.

Turns out the kind of events I like are ones where people get together to physically build something. Because when you build it you have ownership of it. This is the same ethos I brought to our [wedding](https://www.mariannechua.com/cass-and-chris-ultimate-diy-festival-wedding-with-a-woodland-song-tastic-ceremony/). I know that at the time I made our wedding DIY because we'd been to a TONNE of weddings in the few years before ours, and I always thought they looked like they would be so much fun to build, but all you got to do was turn up, see the pretty flowers, then leave! Much more fun to build it together!

Naomi asked a few questions which were bang on the "coach" money and got me having a good old think. One was about what I contributed to open projects, or how they'd got started. I reflected on two projects which I had helped start 1) [eCOBIDAS](https://github.com/Remi-Gau/COBIDAS_chckls) and 2) [Open Research Calendar](https://twitter.com/OpenResearchCal). In both these cases, these were projects which people has been thinking about for a while, but only got off the ground when I made a prototype. In both cases once my prototype was out there, the project took on a life of it's own, which I bloomin' marvellous!  Seems I am creative, proactive, and good at playing with others. I think this work might just be perfect for what I love to do.

I had my call with Naomi in my favourite hiding place in the Library. On the way out I noticed a new "have some you time" jigsaw had arrived, but it had hardly been touched. Looks like it was in the need of some proactive prototyping, so I gave myself a 10 minute treat üòäüß©

Also meeting with my new line manager. Now have a much better idea about what is required - they think they need someone to write training documents, train people and encourage them to use the infrastructure they've built. What they really need is a community of users who are empowered to build the resources they need to use these tools.
