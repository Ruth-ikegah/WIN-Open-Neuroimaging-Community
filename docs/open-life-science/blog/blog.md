# Blog it out

I've decided that I like free form, thought-dump writing. I'm also ~~ok~~ pretty good at it (⚠️ examples here of the narrative blog posts I've written about my experience which have gone down well ⚠️). I also think it will be useful for me and others to have a narrative about what I've learnt over the course of this project and how I've formulated my ideas. So here they are.

Disclaimer: Dyslexia and a desire to get things out rather than make them too neat mean this writing is probably Tom-Marvolo-Riddled with typos. I'm over it.
