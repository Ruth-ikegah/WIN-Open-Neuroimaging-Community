## Week 4 (w/b 10th Feb 2020)

[Cohort call recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9y8a3O4fjg)

My favourite talk this week from the Neuroimaging Methods meeting I help organise: Testing your code! So pleased that I can help share the magic of programming with as many people as turned up! Programming literacy is such an important part of good open research practices for me. I need to speak to some more people about the level it was pitched at, and I know loads of people will benefit from it being unpacked a bit more. Long term goal - get more people programming!

When preparing for the cohort call, I also started to feel like my ambition for the project was too big, or rather the deliverable I'd decided with Naomi ("set up the website") wasn't enough of a stretch. The thoughts actually came to me around 03:00 after my daughter got into bed with us and my mind was racing. What I am good at is events and prototyping. I could probably do a website, but I could also gather an amazing bunch of people to have fun together while building the materials then need. I've been to enough hackathons (like, 3!?!) to know when they work well and when they don't, so I had the idea to run regular (termly) hackathons, and use the brilliance of the OLS project to create a template form the hackathons, along with a feedback mechanism to improve them and allow the community to direct priorities. Very excited about this idea. Means I'll need to re-write my vision and canvas, but that's cool.
