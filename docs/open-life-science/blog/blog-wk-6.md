## Week 6

After a great call with Naomi, I've decided to put the project work of OLS on hold. I am still going to keep up with the calls where possible (because it's great to feel already like I'm part of a community!), take notes during the call and write this blog, but I'm not going to put the additional pressure on myself of completing all the assignments at the timescales they are set.

Towards the end of last week I turned my [repo](https://github.com/cassgvp/WIN-Open-Neuroimaging-Community/) into a [GitHub pages site](https://cassgvp.github.io/WIN-Open-Neuroimaging-Community/) using the instructions provided in the settings pf the repo. Need to work on the README and structure, and get maybe a nicer (easy!) theme.

On the [call](../OLS-Calls/Week6-ProjectDevelopment.md) today we were talking about project management. Glad to find out in the breakout room that others were in the same position as me regarding workload of this program. There was also a very short discussion about "minimal viable products". Malvika suggested that we start the agile process with something where you can get most feedback from people. We should also try to create something which we feel we can accomplish. This is making me think that perhaps I should return to my original idea of making a good repo/website for the community to work from to build the hack. Remembering also Aidan Budd's tip on milestones (also echoed by all the other mentors on the call) - do something small and easy. Maybe I will try to set my first milestone as a full repo/site for Open WIN, and set my pace from that. Note that this was the idea I first went to after thinking that a project about the whole of Oxford Neuroscience was too big. Then I felt like "just" a website would be too small/boring and wouldn't draw in enough of my skills, or rather that other people could do it better. This might be the case (e.g. they could apply a more complicated jekyll theme!), but they still need a decent template/prototype, and I can make that.

Inspired to clean up my README so that it is a decent landing page (currently it's a copy of the OLS GitHub issue). I couldn't remember where the notes about a good readme where, so I've pulled in the other notes from google docs (committed all the notes so we're in a good place. Quite enjoying taking notes in markdown and pushing to repo!!). Now going to clear out the REAME and out place headers based in the example from [STEMM Role Models](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels).

### Jekyll themes
Ugh. I've been trying to get my head around jekyll and themes for far too long.

Themes which I like:
* [pretty-docs](https://leakyabstractions.github.io/pretty-docs/)
* [bulma-clean-theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/bulma-clean-theme/)

I was getting lost in what you need to install (if anything!) and how the basic navigation works (like, what page is rendered on home!). I think I need some more guidance eon this.

Decided to stick with the minimal theme for now, and there is actually a lot of good stuff on the [README](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal).
