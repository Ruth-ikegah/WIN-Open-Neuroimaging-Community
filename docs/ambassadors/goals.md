# What are the goals of the ambassador program?
We have created the ambassador program to ensure as many people as possible can access the sharing infrastructure created by the Open Neuroimaging Project.

We would also like to create opportunities for our community to engage learn best practice in open research, connect with each other, develop their experience and boost their CVs with open research outputs!

We also wanted to create a feedback system where our community of users can shape the environment which they work in. We are at the leading edge of these initiatives, and we firmly believe that our users are excellently positioned to contribute to the future of such efforts.

We have specific goals for engagement which are driven by the results of [WIN 2019 Open Science Survey](https://sharepoint.nexus.ox.ac.uk/sites/NDCN/FMRIB/SitePages/WIN%20Survey%20Results%202019.aspx).

We are also motivated by the [External Advisory Board (EAB)](https://sharepoint.nexus.ox.ac.uk/sites/NDCN/FMRIB/Shared%20Documents/EAB_TOR.pdf#search=external%20review%20board) who are tasked with providing "an external and independent view on plans and progress" of WIN. <mark> Can the 2018 EAB report be shared on intranet too?</mark>.

Based on these combined drivers, our initial goals are to:

## Improve awareness and experience with open research practices

<mark>Much of this should be framed or linked to to the specific infrastructure WIN has created.</mark>

- Improve awareness of open research practices, particularly registered reports and open educational materials.
- Encourage the community to share pre-prints of their papers.

- Appreciate the value of open science practices in career development

- Appreciate the value of open sharing of code.
- Encourage the community to realise the value of sharing data within the current limits of our [open data policy](OpenData.md), and equip them with the tools and knowledge to do so.

## Reduce barriers to engaging in open research practices

- Devise and promote positive incentives for open research within WIN.
- Clarify and communicate legal and ethical obligations fo data sharing.
- Promote and train the community to use the newly developed WIN Open Infrastructure for sharing [data](OpenData.md), [experimental paradigms](OpenParadigms.md), [acquisition protocols](OpenProtocols.md) and [analysis tools](OpenTools.md)

## Create and share Acknowledgements
- Empower the community to learn together as we explore these topics, and share their knowledge on this repository <mark>update when moved</mark> in the form of written documentation.
- Hold in-person and online training workshops and "hacks" where we can learn together and create documentation.
