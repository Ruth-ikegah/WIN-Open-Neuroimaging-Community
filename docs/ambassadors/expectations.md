The behaviours and activities we would like Ambassadors to commit to
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

We would like WIN Open Ambassadors to be aligned with the following activities:

- Commitment to learn about open research practices, understand own knowledge gaps and know where to signpost effectively
- Act as advisors/mentors to other researchers in their research groups, Department and WIN
- Advocate for open research practices an the use of Open WIN Tools in their research groups, Department and WIN
- Speak to researchers about their own experience with open research practices and infrastructure during research group and Departmental presentations and training events
- Participate in Ambassadors meetings once every two months
- Participate in termly co-working hack days where possible
- Engage in community activities for 2-8 hours per month, in addition to the above meeting schedule

In return for their time and commitment, various [rewards and incentives](benfits.md) will be offered to those who become WIN Open Ambassadors.

We will work to support Ambassadors in all these activities, with communication channels, training, presentation materials and defined routes of development. This support will develop as the project grows, and you will have an open invitation to suggest any additional ways we could support you in growing our community.
