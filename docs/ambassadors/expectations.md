- Act as advisors/mentors to other researchers in their research groups, Department and WIN
- Advocate for open research practices an the use of WIN Open Infrastructure in their research groups, Department and WIN
- Speak to researchers about own experience with open research practices and infrastructure during research group and Departmental presentations and training events
- Participate in Ambassadors meetings once every two months
- Participate in termly co-working hack days where possible

In return for their time and commitment, numerous [rewards and incentives](benfits.md) are offered to those who become WIN Open Ambassadors.

We will work to support you in all these activities, with communication channels, additional training, presentation materials and defined routes to development. This support will develop as the project grows, and you have an open invitation to suggest any additional ways we could support you in growing our community.
