In recognition of the time, skill and expertise it takes to be an Open Ambassador, these individuals will be rewarded with:
- Ambassador profiles on this repository
- Named authorship on repository citation
- Early training in how to use the WIN Open Infrastructure for the creation of research outputs.
- Recognition of your contribution on your annual personal development review.
- Opportunities to network with likeminded colleagues internally and externally.
- Opportunity to shape the policy and structure of the WIN Open Neuroimaging Community.

These are some potentially harder benefits to achieve
- Access to a training and development fund to support your growth in open research or a related topic
- Ring-fenced time within your research activities to contribute to the program <mark>Perhaps something like the  PI agreement letter used for the Oxford-Berlin Summer School could be agreed with PIs. Might need to think about how to enforce it.</mark>
- Free merchandise :p <mark>Can we get some mugs made?</mark>
- Access to a dedicated Training Fund to get financial support to organise training in your research group or department. 

What else would you like? We're aiming to solve the problems which you face, or your barriers to working open. Why do you want to participate? What would motivate others like you?
