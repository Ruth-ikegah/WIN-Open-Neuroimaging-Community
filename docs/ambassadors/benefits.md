## Career advancement and exposure
Engaging with open research is good for your CV as many funding and fellowship applications are now requesting and recognising research outputs other than solely papers. For example, preprints, code, datasets and documentation can all be referenced with a digital object identifier (doi) and cited as research outputs. Our hope is that any user of the Open WIN Tools will be able to produce some non-traditional research outputs, however we expect that Ambassadors will stand out as deeply committed to this work.

Ambassadors will have the opportunity to devise and deliver training on these tools, and potentially lead sub-teams who are working on a specific output. These are both excellent experience and opportunities to show leadership on your CV.

Active participation in this community is also evidence of "Good Citizenship" which can be discussed in new employment and promotion applications. It may involve engaging with Senior Management on committees, and you will have the opportunity to learn about background processes in academic life which early career researchers are often not exposed to.
