# Community Personas and Pathways
{: .fs-9 }

Who will our Community Members be, how will they find us and how will we support their journey to leadership?
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

This exercise helps us think about who might be interested in joining our community, how we can connect with them, and the journey they might go on. It is designed to help us reach different audiences and be welcoming to diverse contributors.

Follow the sections below to walk through the exercise and understand how we arrived at our [persona descriptions](#persona-descriptions) and described their [pathways](#pathway-descriptions) to engagement with this community.

# Personas

## What are personas?
"Personas" are a tool used in the design world to help centre the user experience and test features. They are often created from composite of several real-world users, with the intention to put the designers own experience and perspective aside and empathise with the needs and motivations of users.

## Who are the people we most need in this community?

### Experience with open research
We need people who have varying amounts of experience or understanding of open research:
- Already interested and familiar, maybe shared open research outputs
- Vaguely familiar, have heard of "open access" but not a complete understanding of the picture
- No understanding of what open research is or how it benefits them personally or their research program
- Familiar with open research but opposed or experiences significant barriers to participation

### Communication and teamwork
We need people who want to create for their community. Maybe their lab or department. They should have strong communication skills, and a willingness to collaborate as a team.

### Time commitment
We need people with varying amount of time to engage in community work for a sustained period. A Masters student will have a shorter overall duration, but a final year PhD student will have significant competing pressures. Postdoctoral or Core members may have more freedom to explore adjunct projects. Faculty may have less time available, but have "reach" within their Department to promote the efforts of the community.

### Neuroimaging and institutional experience
We need people with varying amounts of experience with neuroimaging. An experienced researcher will have more technical knowledge, but novice users will be invaluable in identifying assumed knowledge in any material we create. Similarly in the amount of experience a community member has working as part of WIN.  

### Computational literacy
It would be great to have community members who are already experienced users of git, markdown, and GitHub or GitLab pages. These people would support the running of hack events by supporting less experienced members where necessary. They would also help streamline the repository and the proposed migration to GitLab. Equally we again need users with little or no experience of these tools or platforms (including command line) to ensure that the material we create is accessible. 

## What are their motivations and needs?

# Pathways

## What is a pathway?
A pathway is a description of how someone interacts with the project or community. It illustrates a potential route from first discovery of the project through to leadership activity.

* [What stumbling blocks could there be for our personas?](#what-stumbling-blocks-could-there-be-for-our-personas?)

No experience of open research

Perceived barriers to open research

Faculty no time available

Students no time available

No experience of git/markdown/command line

No experience with producing detailed documentation

No experience of WIN infrastructure or processes, for example the process for gaining a log-in, joining the mailing list, or obtaining scan data.
