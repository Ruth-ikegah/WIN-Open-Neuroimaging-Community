# 4. Pathway barriers and solutions
{: .fs-9 }

What might be the barriers to engagement for our [personas](personas-3-descriptions.md) and how can we address these?

## Educational

We are expecting (and hoping!) that many of the people who engage with the community will have little experience in the details of open research, research processes at WIN, or technical aspects of how to contribute to this project. It is clear that we need to welcome these people into the community, so we can benefit from their fresh perspective on the material we create and its accessibility to people like themselves.

Where possible we would like to direct to existing resources to fulfil educational needs. These should be carefully curated and relevant to what we are trying to achieve. It should be easy to assimilate (for example directing to captioned videos) as we don't want people to be put off by a long list of required reading.

We expect that some skill gaps (for example contributing to this repository) will need to be addressed as part of this project. This is because not having these skills is a significant barrier to participation in the project and also a skill which is broadly necessary to many open research practices. We also recognise that showing an awareness of the skill gap around contributing to version controlled documentation demonstrates an inclusive environment in terms of technology choices.

Material we will curate and incorporate into introductory educational materials:
- What open research is, why it is beneficial for the individual and progress in the field;
- The value and necessity of good documentation;
- Communication infrastructure, including slack.

No experience of WIN infrastructure or processes, for example the process for gaining a log-in, joining the mailing list, or obtaining scan data.

No experience teaching, for example showing others how to submit a pull request - something about inclusive learning environments, not touching peoples screens etc.

(Would love for the community to create short video lecture series about these things :) )


Material we will create structured leaning around and guide community members through where necessary:
- Contributing to online version controlled documentation, using git, markdown, atom and command line.

No experience with team work, either leading a small group or open communication to ensure team members are not unintentionally doubling up. - guide for how to document progress etc. within each sub-group. How to run a hack project - crib from OHBM OS-SIG Hackathon 2020


## Experiential

We want the experience of working with this community to be positive. We also recognise that everyone will have different levels of time and commitment they can afford to this work.

Faculty no time available

Students no time available

Quick access and sharing for Masters students - they need to be able to get into systems quickly.

Make it easy to dip in and out. Easy to find bits that are appropriate for your skills - good fit tasks.

Catching students at the right point in their courses - Make sure some messaging goes to masters and UG students, maybe in advertising of masters course?

Welcoming - Inclusiveness. What specific points should we recognise someone (e.g. Welcome channel on slack)? Ensure our material and behaviour is of the highest standards in inclusivity. Have this repo reviewed by WIN EDI groups.

Engage people in optional one-to-one interaction, perhaps with Community Coordinator, so they can feel comfortable in approaching.

Develop universally accessible ways to communicate and explain the results of in-person activities - essential for anyone missing from a conversation - open + transparent.



## Motivational

No motivation to share - why sharing is beneficial for the individual

Competing pressures - make it easy to dip in and out. Low effort participation. Slack round up. Poll only channel?

Feeling valued - what can we do to show people how much we value their contributions? Particularly important for people who don't fit the "programmer" trope.  

Development opportunities. Maybe something like buddy system for the day? Check again with OS-SIG hackathon. Specific skills sharing?

Community events and networking

Identification as leaders in this endeavour

Creating, self directing structure and content, within some community agreed boundaries. New ideas always welcome. Consider governance and [Martha's Rules](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007296). Also includes community event design.
