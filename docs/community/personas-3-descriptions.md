# 3. Persona descriptions
{: .fs-9 }

What imaginary characters can we create based on our descriptions of [who we need](personas-1-who.md) and [how they are motivated](personas-2-motivations.md)
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

#### Emoji key
We have used an emoji key to summarise our personas' experience and attitudes to each of the [attributes](personas-1-who.md) we identified as being valuable to the community. These are intended to give you a quick feel for how each persona relates to an attribute. They can be conceptualised by the descriptions given with each image.


## Jesse

| Career stage | Open research experience | Communication and teamwork | Time available | Neuroimaging and Institutional experience | Computational literacy |
|--------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| 🐣 Very fresh! | 🐣 Very fresh! | 💃 Big fan! | 😨 Concerned | 🐣 Very fresh! | 🐣 Very fresh!|   

Jesse is a Masters student. They have come to WIN and Oxford from a different University and have never heard of "open research". They worked hard to get here, they are ambitious, and they want to make friends. They are keen to impress their supervisor and are going to every departmental meeting they can. They are worried about their workload and running our of time for their project. They are a bit overwhelmed by how much there is to learn, but want to be exposed to everything.


## Rowan

| Career stage | Open research experience | Communication and teamwork | Time available | Neuroimaging and Institutional experience | Computational literacy |
|--------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| 🐥 Beginning to know the world | 🙅‍♀️ No thank you! | 🎉  Very experienced | 🌤 Could be better | 🐥 Beginning to know the world | 🐣 Very fresh! |   

Rowan is a PhD Student. They completed a Masters course with a WIN supervisor, and worked as a research assistant for one year before starting a PhD in a different lab. They have worked as part of a team writing ethics applications and collecting data, but now they are leading the whole process for themselves. They have made lots of friends in their time at WIN, but know they need to keep a competitive edge, so they are cautious about how much they share. They have heard people talk unfavourably about open research - it takes too much time; it brings you no personal benefits - and tend to think it's for "someone else".


## Asfar

| Career stage | Open research experience | Communication and teamwork | Time available | Neuroimaging and Institutional experience | Computational literacy |
|--------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| 😸 Knows what is going on and loves it | 👎 Not a great idea | 🙈 Don't ask! | 🌧 Outlook not great! | 💃 Got this down! | 🌤 Could be better |


Asfar is a postdoctoral researcher. They think they know what open research is, but they are worried that their code will be heavily criticised if they share it online. They see open research as a time suck and distraction from papers. They are often asked to support students in running the code and experiments they have written, but this is usually limited to handing over some thin notes. They will be attempting to secure a fellowship in under two years.

## Huan

| Career stage | Open research experience | Communication and teamwork | Time available | Neuroimaging and Institutional experience | Computational literacy |
|--------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| 😼 Knows what is going on and isn't enjoying it | 👋 Welcome! | 💯 Love this! | ⛈ Stormy! | 🌦 Mixed experience  | 🙈 Don't ask! |   

Huan is a postdoctoral researcher. They have significant experience working with clinical populations and are actively engaged in both Patient and Public Involvement in research design and Public Engagement outreach. They manage a constant flow of students, and feel as though they are at capacity with their workload. They enjoy their research, but are considering looking outside of academia as the Principle Investigator track does not appeal. They like the idea of open research, but are not sure if they have much to contribute.

## Siya

| Career stage | Open research experience | Communication and teamwork | Time available | Neuroimaging and Institutional experience | Computational literacy |
|--------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| 🦁 King of the Jungle! | 🙄 Waiting for a mandate | 💃 Big fan! | 😶 Does anyone have time?! | 👑 Knows all the rules | 🐙 Multi-skilled |   

Siya is an established Principle Investigator. They have had a successful academic career and feel comfortable within WIN and University of Oxford structures. They have seen the requirement for open research start to appear in different aspects of their work, for example in requirements for Research Data Management plans in grant applications, and the Research Excellence Framework reference to ["research practice that supports reproducible science"](https://www.ref.ac.uk/media/1084/ref-2019_02-panel-criteria-and-working-methods.pdf), but they are yet to see where this has been truly beneficial for an individual scientist or the research filed as a whole.
