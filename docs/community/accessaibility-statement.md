{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

The Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging (WIN) is committed to providing an accessible web presence that gives members of the public and members of the WIN community full access to centre information, courses and activities offered publicly through the web. Our [Equality Policy](https://www.win.ox.ac.uk/about/edi) outlines our commitment to a culture which maintains a working, learning and social environment in which the rights and dignity of all its staff and students are respected.

This accessibility statement applies to University of Oxford, Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging’s Open Science Websites listed below:
1.	[https://cassgvp.github.io/WIN-Open-Neuroimaging-Community](https://cassgvp.github.io/WIN-Open-Neuroimaging-Community)
2.	[https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk](https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk)
3.	[https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/protocols](https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/protocols)

## Our Aims
These websites are run by WIN’s Open Science team. We want as many people as possible to be able to use these websites. For example, that means you should be able to:

- Change colours, contrast levels and fonts
- Zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
- Navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- Navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
- Listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

How accessible this website
We are aware that some parts of our website are not fully accessible.

These include:

- Not all images have a meaningful text alternative
- Some images include text as part of the image
- Some images do not include sufficiently detailed captions
- Hyperlinks throughout website have a low contrast
- Some hyperlinks are not described sufficiently for screen readers to identify
- Website cannot be effectively navigated by keyboard
- Some subheadings do not have the correct styling so cannot be read effectively by a screen reader

We are working to address areas where our accessibility needs improvement. Please see our ‘Known issues’ page for more details.

## Technical information about this website’s accessibility
The Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, University of Oxford is committed to making its websites accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) AA standard, due to the non-compliance and exemptions listed on our ‘Known Issues page’.

## Known Issues page

### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations
The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons:

### Issues with images
#### Images
- Some images do not have a meaningful text alternative or sufficient captions, so people using a screen reader cannot access the information. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1.

    By October 2021, all images will have meaningful text alternative. Purely decorative images will have blank alternative text and infographics and charts will have a link to a full description of the content.

- Some images include text as part of the image, so people using a screen reader cannot access the information. This fails the WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.5.

    By October 2021, all images containing text will have a suitable text alternative to include the image text.

### Issue with hyperlinks, subheading formatting and keyboard operability
#### Hyperlinks
- Some hyperlinks throughout websites have too low of contrast, which can result in text being difficult to read, especially for people with low vision, poor eyesight or colour blindness. Additionally, some hyperlinks are not sufficiently describe making it difficult to determine purpose when using screen reader. This fails the WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.1.

    All hyperlinks will have a standard 3:1 contract ratio and will be sufficiently described by October 2021.

#### Subheading formatting
- Not all subheadings have been formatted correctly using styles, making the site more difficult for users of assistive technology such as screen readers to access. This fails the WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1.

    Ensure all subheading have been formatted using styles by October 2021.   

#### Keyboard operability
- Some menus, links, buttons, and other controls cannot be operated using the keyboard alone, which can cause problems for people who are blind, have low vision and/or hand tremors. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.1.1.

    We are working with our developers (GitHub) to implement fixes for these keyboard operability issues over the coming months.

#### Issues with Content Management System (CMS)
- The CMS code is being checked to ensure that it meets the robust accessibility criteria 4.1.1, 4.1.2 & 4.1.3.

    This will be done as part of an accessibility review of the GitHub Content Management System to be completed in Autumn 2020.

#### Disproportionate burden
We do not consider any of the accessibility issues to be a disproportionate burden and aim to make the site fully compliant by October 2021.

#### Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations
##### Third-party content
Our site includes third party content and functionality. This may direct you to a related service, link to another site or supporting documentation. We are not responsible for the accessibility of third-party content or to other sites we link to.

This includes:
- Slack
- Wonder.me
- Google Calendar
- Mozilla GitHub
- XNAT

We will provide an accessible alternative to any third-party content that isn’t compliant.

##### Third party platforms
We often create content which is hosted on third party platforms. This includes:

- Content we create for social media
- Data we supply to national databases

We are responsible for ensuring the content we supply meets accessibility requirements. However, we are not responsible for the accessibility of the platform itself.

## What we’re doing to improve accessibility
We want to provide the best possible experience for all our website visitors. To achieve this, we will:

- Fix known issues
- Check all new features in the GitHub Content Management System (CMS), which is used to create this website, for accessibility before they are made available
- Check all new content for accessibility
- Train all content editors on accessibility
- Carry out periodic accessibility checks involving WIN’s accessibility forum, WIN Access

## Preparation of this accessibility statement
This statement was prepared on 22nd October 2020. It was last reviewed on 22nd November 2020.

This website was last tested in October 2020. The test was carried out by the Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging’s Administration Team using all pages. The CMS has been audited for accessibility by the suppliers (GitHub) and the Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging Administration Team. A full copy of the audit results is available by request from the [Open Science Community Coordinator](https://cassgvp.github.io/WIN-Open-Neuroimaging-Community/docs/community/community-who.html#community-coordinator---cassandra-gould-van-praag-sheher)

The pages were checked manually using a combination of the following methods:

- Checked against WCAG 2.1 guidelines, with a focus on the items in the [www.gov.uk WCAG 2.1 Primer Checklist](https://alphagov.github.io/wcag-primer/checklist.html).
