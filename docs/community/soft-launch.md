# Open WIN Community Pages - Soft Launch Strategy
{: .fs-9 }

Getting the first round of feedback on these pages!
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

By [Cass Gould van Praag](https://cassgvp.github.io/WIN-Open-Neuroimaging-Community/docs/community/community-who.html#community-coordinator---cassandra-gould-van-praag-sheher), 27th August 2020

The "soft launch" is the first time we are seeking feedback on these pages from a small selection of people in our community. I am going to follow a strategy structure shared by the excellent team at [The Centre for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement (CSCCE)](https://www.cscce.org/2019/03/14/an-agile-community-strategy-or-how-to-use-okrs-to-say-no-and-stay-focused/). Community vision and mission refined using materials shared via [Community Pulse](https://www.communitypulse.io/50-metrics-kpis-and-okrs/)

The below questions are set at the level of whole project objectives. I'm going to try to frame the answers to understand and meet the objectives of this soft launch.

## 1. What is the world we wish to see? What are we trying to achieve? Why?
*This is big picture thinking that should lead to your organisation’s or community’s vision and mission.*

WIN [Open Neuroimaging vision and mission](https://www.win.ox.ac.uk/about/themes):
> 'Open Science' initiatives aim to make scientific data, code and results openly accessible. This facilitates discovery and hence accelerates the translation of methods and results to the clinic.
> One of the key themes of WIN is to increase the openness of our data, to be a leader in the way that data is shared, and importantly, in how tools (such as the FMRIB Software Library), pipelines and databases can be used to ensure that the data shared is useful to other researchers. However, there are some challenges that need to be overcome, practically, ethically and culturally. These are the challenges that we will be working on over the next five years.
> All members of the WIN management board are committed to sharing their data openly by the end of the 5 year project, and all Centre members are encouraged to do so.

### WIN Open Neuroimaging

#### Mission
"Increase the openness of our data, to be a leader in the way that data is shared, and importantly, in how tools (such as the FMRIB Software Library), pipelines and databases can be used to ensure that the data shared is useful to other researchers."

#### Vision
"Make scientific data, code and results openly accessible [to] facilitate discovery and hence accelerates the translation of methods and results to the clinic."

### Open WIN Community

#### Mission
*A  one-sentence  statement  describing  the  reason your  organization or program  exists.  (what  you  do +  who/what  you  do  this  for).*

##### Actions
To empower; To train; To support.

##### Targeted beneficiaries (The  who/what that  benefits  from  your  work  the  most)
Researchers; Patients; The clinic.

Researchers investigating human brain health and the patients they serve.

##### Services
Tools and practices for sharing research outputs.

##### Problems
Outputs not openly accessible; Slow translation; data and pipelines which are shared are not useful.

##### Cause
Openness; Sharing; human brain health; patients

##### Put together
Supporting open research practices to improve human brain health

#### Vision
I'm going to refine the vision developed during the [Open Life Sciences](https://openlifesci.org) training to be more closely aligned with the WIN vision and mission.

##### Old vision
The Open WIN Community will build a community of researchers who are empowered to develop the training, policies, governance and structures we would like in place to support us in practicing open science.

##### New vision
Openly sharing our research outputs.

### Mission and Vision
**Mission**: To support the use of open research practices to improve human brain health
**Vision**: Open and considered sharing of our research outputs

## 2. How, who (with and for whom) and when (on what timescale)?
*These questions will define the overarching method you use to get to your big-picture vision, or your strategy.*
### How
- Create training materials
- Refine processes
- Devise policy and incentives
- Normalise behaviours
- Create behaviour change
- Build community
- Share knowledge

### Who
- Students
- Researchers
- Core staff
- Principle Investigators
- Clinicians

### When
- 2022


## 3. If your vision is your destination, and strategy is the road you’re taking to get there, what will help you move along this road?
*Which vehicle, how will you acquire it and how will you keep it running? A small number of goals that underpin your mission and strategy are your objectives.*

## 4. What does success look like for these objectives?
*Can you express success as a set of key results that are SMART? (SMART to me means Sensible, Measurable, Achievable (but still challenging), Realistic and Time-bound, but there are variants on this.)*

Coming soon
{: .label .label-yellow }

## 5. Which are the activities and tasks — or programming, content and engagement mechanisms — that might help you achieve these key results, and in which order do you need to do them?
*This last step can help you align your short-term work with objectives (and say no) and then evaluate whether this has worked (has your key result become a reality?).*
