The "soft launch" is the first time we are seeking feedback on these pages from a selection of people in our community. I am going to follow a strategy structure shared by the excellent team at The [Centre for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement (CSCCE)](https://www.cscce.org/2019/03/14/an-agile-community-strategy-or-how-to-use-okrs-to-say-no-and-stay-focused/).
