The "soft launch" is the first time we are seeking feedback on these pages from a small selection of people in our community. I am going to follow a strategy structure shared by the excellent team at [The Centre for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement (CSCCE)](https://www.cscce.org/2019/03/14/an-agile-community-strategy-or-how-to-use-okrs-to-say-no-and-stay-focused/).

The below questions are set at the level of whole project objectives. I'm going to try to frame the answers to understand and meet the objectives of this soft launch.

## 1. What is the world we wish to see? What are we trying to achieve? Why?
> This is big picture thinking that should lead to your organisation’s or community’s vision and mission.



## 2. How, who (with and for whom) and when (on what timescale)?
> These questions will define the overarching method you use to get to your big-picture vision, or your strategy.

## 3. If your vision is your destination, and strategy is the road you’re taking to get there, what will help you move along this road?
> Which vehicle, how will you acquire it and how will you keep it running? A small number of goals that underpin your mission and strategy are your objectives.

## 4. What does success look like for these objectives?
> Can you express success as a set of key results that are SMART? (SMART to me means Sensible, Measurable, Achievable (but still challenging), Realistic and Time-bound, but there are variants on this.)

## 5. Which are the activities and tasks — or programming, content and engagement mechanisms — that might help you achieve these key results, and in which order do you need to do them?
> This last step can help you align your short-term work with objectives (and say no) and then evaluate whether this has worked (has your key result become a reality?).
