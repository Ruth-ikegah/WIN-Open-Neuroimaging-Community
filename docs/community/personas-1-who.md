# 1. Who do we need in the community?

What range of people should we cover in our personas exploration?

## Experience with open research
We need people who have varying amounts of experience or understanding of open research:
- Already interested and familiar, maybe shared open research outputs;
- Vaguely familiar, have heard of "open access" but not a complete understanding of the breadth of open research practices;
- No understanding of what open research is, how it benefits them personally or their research program;
- Familiar with open research but opposed or experiences significant barriers to participation;

## Communication and teamwork
We need people who want to create for their community (maybe their lab or department), and support the growth of others along with themselves. They should have strong communication skills or a motivation to share, and a willingness to collaborate as a team.

## Time commitment
We need people with varying amount of time to engage in community work for a sustained period. A Masters student will have a short overall duration to engage, and an even shorter time to prepare their own outputs. A PhD student will have a longer project duration, but significant competing pressures in their write-up period. Postdoctoral or Core members may have more freedom to explore adjunct projects. Faculty may have less time available, but have "reach" within their Department to promote the efforts of the community.

## Neuroimaging and institutional experience
We need people with varying amounts of experience with neuroimaging. An experienced researcher will have more technical knowledge, but novice users will be invaluable in identifying assumed knowledge in any material we create. Similarly in the amount of experience a community member has working as part of WIN.  

## Computational literacy
It would be great to have community members who are already experienced users of git, markdown, and GitHub or GitLab pages. These people would support the running of hack events by supporting less experienced members where necessary. They would also help streamline the repository and the proposed migration to GitLab. Equally we again need users with little or no experience of these tools or platforms (including command line) to ensure that the material we create is accessible.
