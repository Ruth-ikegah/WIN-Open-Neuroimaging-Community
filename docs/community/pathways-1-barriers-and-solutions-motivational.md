## Motivational

No motivation to share - why sharing is beneficial for the individual

Feeling valued - what can we do to show people how much we value their contributions? Particularly important for people who don't fit the "programmer" trope.  

Development opportunities. Maybe something like buddy system for the day? Check again with OS-SIG hackathon. Specific skills sharing?

Community events and networking

Identification as leaders in this endeavour

Creating, self directing structure and content, within some community agreed boundaries. New ideas always welcome. Consider governance and [Martha's Rules](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007296). Also includes community event design.
