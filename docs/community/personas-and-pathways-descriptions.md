# 4.0 Persona and pathway descriptions
{: .fs-9 }

What imaginary characters can we create based on our descriptions of [who we need](personas-1-who.md) and [how they are motivated](personas-2-motivations.md) and how will they journey through this project?
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

For each of our personas, we have imagined how they might interact with the project. Our consideration of barriers to participation ([educational](pathways-1-barriers-and-solutions-educational.md), [experiential](pathways-1-barriers-and-solutions-experiential.md), [inclusivity](pathways-1-barriers-and-solutions-inclusivity.md) and [motivational](pathways-1-barriers-and-solutions-motivational.md)) should have caught any potential sticking points in their progression.

For each persona we will model their path through the [mountain of engagement](mountain-of-engagement.md) in the following steps:
1. Discovery - How they first hear about the project or group.
2. First Contact - How they first engage with the project or group, that initial interaction.
3. Participation - How they first participate or contribute.
4. Sustained Participation - How their contribution or involvement can continue.
5. Networked Participation - How they may network within the community.
6. Leadership - How they may take on some additional responsibility on the project, or begin to lead.

## Rowan

| Career stage | Open research experience | Communication and teamwork | Time available | Neuroimaging and Institutional experience | Computational literacy |
|--------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| 🐥 Beginning to know the world | 🙅‍♀️ No thank you! | 🎉  Very experienced | 🌤 Could be better | 🐥 Beginning to know the world | 🐣 Very fresh! |   

Rowan is a PhD Student. They completed a Masters course with a WIN supervisor, and worked as a research assistant for one year before starting a PhD in a different lab. They have worked as part of a team writing ethics applications and collecting data, but now they are leading the whole process for themselves. They have made lots of friends in their time at WIN, but know they need to keep a competitive edge, so they are cautious about how much they share. They have heard people talk unfavourably about open research - it takes too much time; it brings you no personal benefits - and tend to think it's for "someone else".

#### 1. Discovery
Doesn't attend WIN presentation on Open Community. Hears about it from a friend.

#### 2. First contact
See announcement of WIN presentation recording on WIN mailing list. Watches talk recording. Doesn't hate it.

#### 3. Participation
Sees announcement of documentation hack preparatory "Ask Me Anything" call. Attends. Expresses concerns about sharing research outputs taking time.

#### 4. Sustained Participation
Joins Slack. Follows updates about documentation release. Uses shares acquisition protocol using community developed documentation.

#### 5. Networked Participation
Wants to add more research outputs to their CV, so asks about how to become a named contributor.

#### 6. Leadership
Reviews, restructures and updates open acquisition documentation.


## Asfar

| Career stage | Open research experience | Communication and teamwork | Time available | Neuroimaging and Institutional experience | Computational literacy |
|--------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| 😸 Knows what is going on and loves it | 👎 Not a great idea | 🙈 Don't ask! | 🌧 Outlook not great! | 💃 Got this down! | 🌤 Could be better |


Asfar is a postdoctoral researcher. They think they know what open research is, but they are worried that their code will be heavily criticised if they share it online. They see open research as a time suck and distraction from papers. They are often asked to support students in running the code and experiments they have written, but this is usually limited to handing over some thin notes. They will be attempting to secure a fellowship in under two years.

#### 1. Discovery
Attends WIN presentation, because the title promotes time saving and CV boost.  

#### 2. First contact
Reviews this repository for open tasks and analysis documentation. Spots opportunity to lead some of the community decision making for career advancement.  

#### 3. Participation
Attends documentation hack. Creates material for how to contribute to open tasks repository.

#### 4. Sustained Participation
Writes good documentation for their own tasks, shares them on open tasks repository.

#### 5. Networked Participation

Huan is a postdoctoral researcher. They have significant experience working with clinical populations and are actively engaged in both Patient and Public Involvement in research design and Public Engagement outreach. They manage a constant flow of students, and feel as though they are at capacity with their workload. They enjoy their research, but are considering looking outside of academia as the Principle Investigator track does not appeal. They like the idea of open research, but are not sure if they have much to contribute.

## Siya

| Career stage | Open research experience | Communication and teamwork | Time available | Neuroimaging and Institutional experience | Computational literacy |
|--------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| 🦁 King of the Jungle! | 🙄 Waiting for a mandate | 💃 Big fan! | 😶 Does anyone have time?! | 👑 Knows all the rules | 🐙 Multi-skilled |   

Siya is an established Principle Investigator. They have had a successful academic career and feel comfortable within WIN and University of Oxford structures. They have seen the requirement for open research start to appear in different aspects of their work, for example in requirements for Research Data Management plans in grant applications, and the Research Excellence Framework reference to ["research practice that supports reproducible science"](https://www.ref.ac.uk/media/1084/ref-2019_02-panel-criteria-and-working-methods.pdf), but they are yet to see where this has been truly beneficial for an individual scientist or the research filed as a whole.

#### 1. Discovery
Hears mention of Open WIN Community in Head of Department briefing.

#### 2. First contact
One of their students asks to attend a documentation hack.

#### 3. Participation
One of their postdocs asks to share an acquisition protocol or task (nothing too controversial). They agree and attach it as supplementary information on a paper. They are a named author.

#### 4. Sustained Participation
Discusses with lab what other outputs can be shared.

#### 5. Networked Participation
Speaks to other Principle Investigators about how their latest paper is more "REF-able" with the added supplementary outputs.

#### 6. Leadership
Sets lab policy or intention to make all possible outputs openly shareable. Gives team time and resources to contribute to the community.
