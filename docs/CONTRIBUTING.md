<mark>This section needs completing</mark>

We want to ensure that every user and contributor feels welcome and included in the WIN Open Neuroimaging community.

We hope that this guideline document will make it as easy as possible for you to get involved.

Please follow these guidelines to make sure your contributions can be easily integrated in the projects. As you start contributing to the WIN Open Neuroimaging, don't forget that your ideas are more important than perfect pull requests (!).

In the first instance, we encourage you to contact <Cassandra.GouldVanPraag@psych.ox.ac.uk> or get in touch with one of our [Ambassadors](OpenAmbasadros.md) ...

<mark>This should outline mountain of engagement. Also link to events, mailing lists and slack.</mark>

You can see the things we are working on in the [Ambassadors Trello board](https://trello.com/b/u4FqvNJv) <mark>this board is incomplete</mark>.

## Using git
<mark>Should also contain a how-to on using git to contribute to this repo. Maybe a video recording of the hack-day (and/or Ox-Ber) training, with linked materials<mark>
