# Why are we using Git for creating resources?

We are building our resources and documenting our growth using this version controlled git repository, rendered into an accessible "book" format. Using git makes it easy to review and accept contributions and flexibly update with a full history of activity. It also provides a starting point for researchers who are unfamiliar with git to practice contributing to a repository and gain confidence using the git process. This is an essential skill in open and reproducible research, an excellent skill to have on your CV, and one which will be vital to using some parts of the WIN Open Infrastructure. We are therefore pleased to offer all our contributors training and support in git throughout their engagement with the project. You will find training and linked resources for using git in our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
