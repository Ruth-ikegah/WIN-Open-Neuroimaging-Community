# Why are we using Git for creating resources?

This repository and the resources contained within it are built using a [version controlled git repository](https://github.com/cassgvp/WIN-Open-Neuroimaging-Community), rendered into an accessible "book" format.

Using git makes it easy to review and accept contributions and flexibly update our resources with a full history of activity.

Working this way also provides an accessible starting point for researchers who are unfamiliar with git to practice contributing to a repository and gain confidence using the git process. Using git is essential in open and reproducible research and an excellent skill to have on your CV.

We are pleased to offer all our contributors training and support in git throughout their engagement with the project. You will also find linked resources for using git in our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
