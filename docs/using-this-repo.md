# Why are we using Git for creating resources?

This repository and the resources contained within it are built using a [version controlled git repository](https://github.com/cassgvp/WIN-Open-Neuroimaging-Community), rendered into an accessible "book" format.

Using git makes it easy to review and accept contributions from many different people, and flexibly update our resources with a full history of activity.

Working this way also provides an accessible starting point for researchers who are unfamiliar with git to practice contributing to a repository and gain confidence using the git process. Using git is essential in open and reproducible research and an excellent skill to have on your CV.

We are pleased to offer all our contributors training and support in git throughout their engagement with the project.

Don't worry, no one really knows how to use git.<sup>1</sup> [https://xkcd.com/1597/](https://xkcd.com/1597/)

<sup>1</sup> Of course some people have had a lot of opportunity and need for practice and really do know how to use git. The point is for many of us and our applications, 'simple' git is sufficient and already a big step.
