We are currently planning the first (online!) community documentation hack.

<mark>Date TBC. Potentially 3rd week of October</mark>

The aim for the hack day is to:
1. Introduce interested community members to the Ambassador program, and communicate more fully how you may benefit from being an ambassador, what kind of activities you may be able to take part in, how you will be rewarded and recognised for your contribution, and what behaviours or commitment may be expected of you. These issues will be discussed and guiding principles generated by those involved.
2. Provide trining on the newly developed open infrastructure.
3. Provide training on github <mark> likely gitlab </mark> and how it will be used to update this repository.
4. Begin crafting and contributing documentation to share our training with others

A draft outline of the hack-day schedule is below.
