## Purpose

We will develop a searchable, user friendly database to store MRI, EEG and MEG scan data directly from the scanners.  The database will also have the capability to store other research data alongside the scans to create a research dataset.  Image conversion tools will be integrated into the database to convert raw image files to standard formats.  The database will have the capability to share data at PI group level, WIN level and externally at the control of the PI.  Shared research datasets will be able to be combined to create new research datasets.




International community data standards - specifically the [Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)](https://bids.neuroimaging.io) - have been employed to ensure that shared pipelines are compatible with tools developed elsewhere. This working group is also committed to actively engaging with the future development of BIDS, to ensure lifetime compatibility between FSL and the wide data standards.
