## Purpose

The Open Data Working Group has built a searchable, user friendly database to store MRI, EEG and MEG scan data directly from the scanners.  The database also has the capability to store other research data alongside the scans to create a research dataset.  Image conversion tools are be integrated into the database to convert raw image files to standard formats and the community standard [Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)](https://bids.neuroimaging.io) file structures.

Data will only ever be shared when the participant has given explicit consent to open sharing. All access protocols have been developed to ensure the highest levels of security to protect against accidental or malicious data breaches.  

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliant data sharing policy
The database has the capability to share data at between specified individuals, openly to all WIN members, or externally based on the requirements of the research lead.

#### De-identification
Before data is shared externally, it will be checked against a list of defined criteria to ensure the data are appropriately de-identified and any risk of identification of individual participants is negligible. The criteria for de-identification will include removal of identifying facial features (defacing), the removal of personal data from raw [dicom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM) images, and the removal of any linkage with consent or experimental participant identification numbers.

#### Data usage Agreement
Individuals accessing shared data will additionally be required to agree to a Data Usage Policy, where they explicitly confirm that they will not attempt to re-identify participants, nor share the data with any third party who has not signed the same agreement.

The Data Usage Agreement and de-identification process is being developed with the support of Departmental and University level [Information Security and Compliance](https://www.infosec.ox.ac.uk) teams.

#### Quality control
WIN members will also be encouraged to run and share the results of predefined quality control algorithms, so anyone accessing the data can have a ready measure of image quality.

## For external researchers
External users will be able to search the database for data which individual research teams have chosen to make openly available. These may be deposited to support publications as supplementary methods material, or they may form the main body of research in data papers.
