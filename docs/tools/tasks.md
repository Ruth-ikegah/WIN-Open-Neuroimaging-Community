# Open Tasks
{: .fs-9 }

How to share your experimental tasks

## Purpose
The Open Tasks working group aims to encourage and incentivise researchers designing experimental tasks for functional neuroimaging to share these tasks openly with other researchers. They have established online repository for these paradigms to be shared, alongside documentation and analysis scripts for behavioural results. This working group also aims to train new members of the centre in open-source coding languages for paradigm development, and sharing reproducible environments.

**THIS TOOL IS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT. PLEASE REFER TO THE INFORMATION BELOW TO UNDERSTAND THE AIM AND AMBITION OF THIS PROJECT. THE "HOW TO" GUIDE WILL BE BUILT BY THE COMMUNITY AND TOOL DEVELOPERS IN THE COMING MONTHS.**

[![For WIN members](../img/btn-win.png)](https://cassgvp.github.io/WIN-Open-Neuroimaging-Community/docs/tools/tasks.html#for-win-members)      [![For external researchers](../img/btn-external.png)](https://cassgvp.github.io/WIN-Open-Neuroimaging-Community/docs/tools/tasks.html#for-external-researchers)

## For WIN members
#### Version control ![version-control](../img/icon-version-control.png)
The Open Tasks repository is maintained in the WIN GitLab server. WIN members are invited to deposit their task code and materials when they are using a stable version, by cloning from their own GitLab or GitHub repository. This implies that WIN members will be using a git process when developing their task, and as such their development journey will be version controlled.

#### Citable research output ![doi](../img/icon-doi.png)
Versions of task materials can be assigned a digital object identified (DOI) using [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) by uploading individual task repositories from GitLab. Once a DOI has been created, your task material becomes a citable object which you can add to your list of research outputs.

#### Reproducible methods detail ![reproduce](../img/icon-reproduce.png)
WIN members will be supported in developing the necessary and sufficient documentation and running environments to enable others to launch, maintain and adapting their tasks. This facilitates effective re-use and modification of tasks within a research group, and with external collaborators.


## For external researchers
External users will be able to search the repository for experimental tasks which individual research teams have chosen to make openly available. Searches may be conducted using keyword terms based on the author, theoretical application, or stimulus type. Task materials may be deposited to support publications as supplementary methods material, or they may form the main body of research in new task development.

## How to use
### Access
Access the Open Tasks repository via the [WIN Open Science GitLab group](https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/open-science)

Coming soon

Detailed guidance on how to use the Open Tasks repository will be produced during one of our [documentation hacks](../events/doc-hack-1.md)
