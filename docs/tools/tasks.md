## Purpose
The Open Tasks working group aims to encourage and incentivise researchers designing experimental paradigms for functional neuroimaging to share these paradigms freely with other researchers. They have established online repository for these paradigms to be shared, alongside documentation and analysis scripts for behavioural results. This working group also aims to train new members of the centre in open-source coding languages for paradigm development.

**External users will be able to search the repository for experimental tasks which individual research teams have chosen to make openly available**. Searches may be conducted using keyword terms based on the author, theoretical application, or stimulus type.

## Usage
### WIN Members
The Open Tasks repository is maintained in the WIN GitLab server. WIN members are invited to deposit their task code and materials when they are using a stable version, by cloning from their own GitLab or GitHub repository. Once deposited, all task materials will be publicly available. Task materials may be deposited before the task has been used in a publication where this has been approved by the Principle Investigator.

Versions of task materials can be assigned a digital object identified (DOI) using [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) by uploading individual task repositories from GitLab. Once a DOI has been created, your task material becomes a citable object which you can add to your list of research outputs.
