How to share reproducible FSL analysis pipelines
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

## Purpose

We will work with researchers to capture details of the FSL tools that they use in data processing, in order to ensure that their research outputs are reproducible. We will develop systems to enable them to easily publish both the tools and the steps used in processing the data along with the data itself.  We will actively engage in the use and future development of the BIDS data structure to facilitate sharing.
