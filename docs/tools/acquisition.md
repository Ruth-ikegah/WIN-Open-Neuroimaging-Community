## Purpose

The Open Acquisition working group have developed a database of scanner protocols with a web interface to enable protocols to be shared both across WIN and externally. The database provides access to standard protocols and to the latest experimental protocols and where these have been uploaded by WIN members.

**External users will be able to search the database for acquisition protocols which individual research teams have chosen to make openly available**. Searches may be conducted using keyword terms based on anatomy, the imaging system, sequence types, or the theoretical application.

## Usage
### WIN members
The acquisition database is version controlled, so WIN members are invited to upload their protocols during pilotting to keep track of optimisation and final versions. Comments and notes can be added to

Versions (with minor and major edits) can be assigned a digital object identified (DOI) using the [Oxford Research Archive (ORA) Data repository](https://deposit.ora.ox.ac.uk) using the stable link provided by the acquisition database. Once a DOI has been created, your acquisition protocol becomes a citable object which you can add to your list of research outputs.

## Access
Access the [Open Acquisition Database](https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/protocols/) (requires a connection to the [FMRIB VPN](https://sharepoint.nexus.ox.ac.uk/sites/NDCN/FMRIB/IT/User%20Guides/VPN.aspx))

## How to use

Detailed guidance on how to use the Open Acquisition database will be produced during one of our [documentation dashes](../events/doc-dash-1.md)
