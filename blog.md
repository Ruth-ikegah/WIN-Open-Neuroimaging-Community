# Blog it out

I've decided that I like free form, thought-dump writing. I'm also ~~ok~~ pretty good at it (‚ö†Ô∏è examples here of the narrative blog posts I've written about my experience which have gone down well ‚ö†Ô∏è). I also think it will be useful for me and others to have a narrative about what I've learnt over the course of this project and how I've formulated my ideas. So here they are.

Disclaimer: Dyslexia and a desire to get things out rather than make them too neat mean this writing is probably Tom-Marvolo-Riddled with typos. I'm over it.

## Week 0
I've been offered the opportunity to act as the Oxford Neuroscience Open Science Co-Ordinator. It is unbelievably exciting, but it is a huge task because there is SO MUCH I want to do with it. The job role on paper is to:
> ... Develop a deep understanding of the opportunities and challenges associated with open science across contexts. The new post-holder will work between departments and alongside partners in other institutions to develop policies and recommendations for good governance that work for individual facilities (e.g. WIN), across departmental boundaries within medical sciences (e.g. Oxford Neuroscience), and then beyond into the wider University and national networks (e.g. Dementias Platform UK). The aim is to develop an open science community through an understanding of the principles of behaviour change, including recognising scientific and individual risks and benefits for research participants, researchers (at all levels), and the institution.  

I learnt about this [Open Life Sciences Mentoring Program](https://openlifesci.org) from Malvika Sharan at [Avengers for Better Science Leiden 2019](https://avengers-for-better-science.github.io). I was super excited about the prospect of mentorship in this area, but wasn't sure if I had a decent project to fit into it. After speaking to Malvika, I knew this new role would be perfect. I am also INCREDIBLY grateful to have some really strong guidance as I attempt to help lead a really big collection of amazingly successful researchers into a new way of working... I hope we're all right! üò¨üòÉü§™ü§ì

## Week 1

## Week 3
First call with Naomi. ‚ö†Ô∏è[notes will go here]‚ö†Ô∏è.

Turns out the kind of events I like are ones where people get together to physically build something. Because when you build it you have ownership of it. This is the same ethos I brought to our [wedding](https://www.mariannechua.com/cass-and-chris-ultimate-diy-festival-wedding-with-a-woodland-song-tastic-ceremony/). I know that at the time I made our wedding DIY because we'd been to a TONNE of weddings in the few years before ours, and I always thought they looked like they would be so much fun to build, but all you got to do was turn up, see the pretty flowers, then leave! Much more fun to build it together!

Naomi asked a few questions which were bang on the "coach" money and got me having a good old think. One was about what I contributed to open projects, or how they'd got started. I reflected on two projects which I had helped start 1) [eCOBIDAS](https://github.com/Remi-Gau/COBIDAS_chckls) and 2) [Open Research Calendar](https://twitter.com/OpenResearchCal). In both these cases, these were projects which people has been thinking about for a while, but only got off the ground when I made a prototype. In both cases once my prototype was out there, the project took on a life of it's own, which I bloomin' marvellous!  Seems I am creative, proactive, and good at playing with others. I think this work might just be perfect for what I love to do.

I had my call with Naomi in my favourite hiding place in the Library. On the way out I noticed a new "have some you time" jigsaw had arrived, but it had hardly been touched. Looks like it was in the need of some proactive prototyping, so I gave myself a 10 minute treat üòäüß©

Also meeting with my new line manager. Now have a much better idea about what is required - they think they need someone to write training documents, train people and encourage them to use the infrastructure they've built. What they really need is a community of users who are empowered to build the resources they need to use these tools.


## Week 4 (w/b 10th Feb 2020)

[Cohort call recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9y8a3O4fjg)

My favourite talk this week from the Neuroimaging Methods meeting I help organise: Testing your code! So pleased that I can help share the magic of programming with as many people as turned up! Programming literacy is such an important part of good open research practices for me. I need to speak to some more people about the level it was pitched at, and I know loads of people will benefit from it being unpacked a bit more. Long term goal - get more people programming!

When preparing for the cohort call, I also started to feel like my ambition for the project was too big, or rather the deliverable I'd decided with Naomi ("set up the website") wasn't enough of a stretch. The thoughts actually came to me around 03:00 after my daughter got into bed with us and my mind was racing. What I am good at is events and prototyping. I could probably do a website, but I could also gather an amazing bunch of people to have fun together while building the materials then need. I've been to enough hackathons (like, 3!?!) to know when they work well and when they don't, so I had the idea to run regular (termly) hackathons, and use the brilliance of the OLS project to create a template form the hackathons, along with a feedback mechanism to improve them and allow the community to direct priorities. Very excited about this idea. Means I'll need to re-write my vision and canvas, but that's cool.


## Week 5 (w/b 17th Feb 2020)

I've been umm'ing and ahh'ing about how to host this project. I think I'm settled on the idea that for now I will do it all in my own repo. Some of the materials (like code of conduct etc.) can then be forked over to where WIN want them. I would LIKE to keep the whole project on github rather than our internal gitlab server as:
 1. It's not entirely straightforward to get people gitlab accounts so they can contribute to the gitlab project;
 2. Only people who are developers on the gitlab project can comment. That makes the conversation (e.g. the currently shared information about [available stimuli](https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/open-science)) a bit one-sided, and we can do better than that;
 3. Github also seems to have more social and project management functionality than our gitlab server. I'm willing to be proven wrong on this as I've only explored a little;
 4. There is more easily available help for GitHub, and more of the projects I am taking guidance from (e.g. [The Turing Way](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way)) are using it. I've spoken to Kirstie about this, and although there are some concerns about the ownership of GitHub, this is where the community is at the moment, and you need to use the tools the community are familiar with;
 5. Our users will be better served for continued collaborative working if they are practiced in the tool which is most frequently used elsewhere, and this (as shown in Kirstie's comments and my own experience with other open neuroimaging projects) is GitHub.

So today I made this my repo on GitHub. I've spent a while looking through how some different projects are rendered into "website" looking things which can be accessed without the unfamiliarity of a git-looking page (e.g. [Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/introduction/introduction), [OS-SIG](https://ossig.netlify.com), [Stephan Heunis' blog](https://jsheunis.github.io), [Reproducible Research Oxford](https://ox.ukrn.org)), but I'm not sure yet what is going to be the best way to do it. I've gotten over that. It's more important that I get this space working for me, then we can look at how to make it more outwardly beautiful. My guess is that I'll feel better about this once we've made the site for the [OHBM OSR](‚ö†Ô∏èlink‚ö†Ô∏è), and it would probably be wise to talk to the people who (I hope!) will be helping me build it. A interim decision might need to happen before the first hack, but that's cool, I'm excited about learning the process. The other big decision about hosting it on GitHub is what to call it and whether I'll be allowed to put WIN branding etc. on a place which can be openly contributed to...

I've also decided to ask Naomi to work on our collaborative call documents in hackmd.io. This means I'll be able to add them straight to the repo and I can keep all our call notes open (which I'm totally fine about). Feels like this will also be a good collaborative tool to get people comfortable with, so I should probably be comfortable with it. For reference, I'm writing this markdown in atom with the preview toggle on. It's sweet. Image resizing took a few mins of playing from [this chat](https://gist.github.com/uupaa/f77d2bcf4dc7a294d109#gistcomment-2229426), but I think what I've got here works fine.

Also really excited about writing this blog stuff out! Today I filled in some stuff from previous weeks, and it's feels really good to get down some of the thoughts I've been having. This is also acting a but like my lab notebook, and helping me clarify some decisions. I've still got a fair  amount to transfer from my google drive, and I need to make sure I don't spend too much time writing! Maybe just a couple of paragraphs a week. Today was a special occasion as the repo has landed! ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Week 6

After a great call with Naomi, I've decided to put the project work of OLS on hold. I am still going to keep up with the calls where possible (because it's great to feel already like I'm part of a community!), take notes during the call and write this blog, but I'm not going to put the additional pressure on myself of completing all the assignments at the timescales they are set.

Towards the end of last week I turned my [repo](https://github.com/cassgvp/WIN-Open-Neuroimaging-Community/) into a [GitHub pages site](https://cassgvp.github.io/WIN-Open-Neuroimaging-Community/) using the instructions provided in the settings pf the repo. Need to work on the README and structure, and get maybe a nicer (easy!) theme.

On the [call](../OLS-Calls/Week6-ProjectDevelopment.md) today we were talking about project management. Glad to find out in the breakout room that others were in the same position as me regarding workload of this program. There was also a very short discussion about "minimal viable products". Malvika suggested that we start the agile process with something where you can get most feedback from people. We should also try to create something which we feel we can accomplish. This is making me think that perhaps I should return to my original idea of making a good repo/website for the community to work from to build the hack. Remembering also Aidan Budd's tip on milestones (also echoed by all the other mentors on the call) - do something small and easy. Maybe I will try to set my first milestone as a full repo/site for Open WIN, and set my pace from that. Note that this was the idea I first went to after thinking that a project about the whole of Oxford Neuroscience was too big. Then I felt like "just" a website would be too small/boring and wouldn't draw in enough of my skills, or rather that other people could do it better. This might be the case (e.g. they could apply a more complicated jekyll theme!), but they still need a decent template/prototype, and I can make that.

Inspired to clean up my README so that it is a decent landing page (currently it's a copy of the OLS GitHub issue). I couldn't remember where the notes about a good readme where, so I've pulled in the other notes from google docs (committed all the notes so we're in a good place. Quite enjoying taking notes in markdown and pushing to repo!!). Now going to clear out the REAME and out place headers based in the example from [STEMM Role Models](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels).

### Jekyll themes
Ugh. I've been trying to get my head around jekyll and themes for far too long.

Themes which I like:
* [pretty-docs](https://leakyabstractions.github.io/pretty-docs/)
* [bulma-clean-theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/bulma-clean-theme/)

I was getting lost in what you need to install (if anything!) and how the basic navigation works (like, what page is rendered on home!). I think I need some more guidance eon this.

Decided to stick with the minimal theme for now, and there is actually a lot of good stuff on the [README](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal).
