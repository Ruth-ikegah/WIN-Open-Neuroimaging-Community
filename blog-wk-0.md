# Week 0
I've been offered the opportunity to act as the Oxford Neuroscience Open Science Co-Ordinator. It is unbelievably exciting, but it is a huge task because there is SO MUCH I want to do with it. The job role on paper is to:
> ... Develop a deep understanding of the opportunities and challenges associated with open science across contexts. The new post-holder will work between departments and alongside partners in other institutions to develop policies and recommendations for good governance that work for individual facilities (e.g. WIN), across departmental boundaries within medical sciences (e.g. Oxford Neuroscience), and then beyond into the wider University and national networks (e.g. Dementias Platform UK). The aim is to develop an open science community through an understanding of the principles of behaviour change, including recognising scientific and individual risks and benefits for research participants, researchers (at all levels), and the institution.  

I learnt about this [Open Life Sciences Mentoring Program](https://openlifesci.org) from Malvika Sharan at [Avengers for Better Science Leiden 2019](https://avengers-for-better-science.github.io). I was super excited about the prospect of mentorship in this area, but wasn't sure if I had a decent project to fit into it. After speaking to Malvika, I knew this new role would be perfect. I am also INCREDIBLY grateful to have some really strong guidance as I attempt to help lead a really big collection of amazingly successful researchers into a new way of working... I hope we're all right! ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜ƒðŸ¤ªðŸ¤“
