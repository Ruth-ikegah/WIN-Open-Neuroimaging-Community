Designing for equity & engagement through community interactions
## POP
* Purpose: To identify and improve community interactions within your organization and community.
* Outcomes: Ensuring equitable outcomes for current interactions and developing new interactions with equitable value exchanges.
* Process: Where am I now? → Where do I want it to be? → Review with mentor → Share via Gitter, next cohort call

## Prompt
### Where am I now?
Completed by Cassandra Gould van Praag 6th February 2020

| What kinds of community interactions exist in my organization’s internal culture and external community? | What kinds of value exchanges go with these interactions? Do I think they are equitable? |
| ------------- |-------------  |
| Example: We frequently **solicit ideas** from people inside the organization about how to improve meetings. | Example: We don’t **recognize** the people whose ideas we use and we don’t explain our decision-making when we do change meeting structures. This doesn’t seem equitable to me. |
| We frequently **inform** people of initiatives (such as talks) which have been arranged for their benefit. Example: “As part of our XXXX theme in XXXX, and just to promote sharing of ideas/approaches/methods/knowledge related to ongoing XXXX research, we are launching a new series of monthly meetings called XXXX. The aim is to create a supportive and informed network of researchers to promote collaboration and sharing of skills and expertise within and beyond the Department of XXXX  for those interested in XXXX research. Rather than formal presentations, the idea is to have a casual conversational style of get-together for sharing of research aims, approaches, resources, obstacles, and findings. Meetings will be held at 11.00 – 12.00 on the first Friday of the month in the reception, and coffee and pastries will be provided.  Everyone at XXXX, YYYYY and ZZZZ Departments are encouraged to attend. Our first speaker will be XXXX kicking us off on Friday 7th February. Please join us at 11am to for an informal discussion with XXXX on XXXX. Please help us make this new meeting a great success. Until soon, Very Senior Professor”     | The organisation of these talks and meetings is **imposed**, top-down and unidirectional. There was no advertised opportunity to contribute to the development of the schedule, and no consideration of inclusivity in timings. For example, meeting dates and times are not rotated (it is being held in one of three sites) nor was there any mention of the event being recorded for live or later broadcast  - I do not work on Friday’s due to caring commitments and I therefore can never attend this meeting. There was no call to suggest speakers or ask the community who they would like to hear from.      |





### Where do I want it to be?
| What kinds of community interactions would I like to have in my organization’s internal culture and external community? | What kind of equitable value exchanges would I like my organization to offer as part of these interactions? |
| ----------- | ----------|
Example: We should make time during each meeting for a new voice to try something new, like giving thanks or reporting out on a project that’s below most people’s radars. That way we could **solicit ideas** about our meeting structures and **co-create** parts of their agendas together. | Example: We could recognize these new speakers in the agendas we send out before meetings and make sure that we rotate through all staff and invite everyone to suggest something to try. We could also share some of our decision-making about why we’d like to try their ideas in the same emails. This would help us **recognize** people who contribute new ideas and **share information** more openly among staff. |
We should invite members of this community to **build the resources they require together**. For example, there should be a well communicated method for contributing to speaker suggestions, ask them to identify particular stumbling blocks they have in sharing of research ideas etc. | We should recognise that **physical and temporal barriers** will prevent members of the community participating in this forum. We should improve **accessibility** and thereby **diversity of contribution** by advertising that the conversation will be recorded, and/or the meeting location will be rotated.|
