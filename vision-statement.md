# Vision statement

I’m working with 225 research groups across Oxford Neuroscience to create a community of open and inclusive researchers who will develop the policies, governance and structures we would like in place to support us in practicing open science.

I’m working open because I believe this is the most effective way to deliver justice oriented science.
