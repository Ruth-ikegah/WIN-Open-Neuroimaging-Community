# WIN-Open-Neuroimaging-Community

This repository contains materials for the cultivation of the University of Oxford Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging (WIN) Open Neuroimaging Community.

Materials are being developed with the support of the [Open Life Sciences (OLS) Mentoring Program](https://openlifesci.org), with the kind assistance of [Naomi Penfold](https://github.com/npscience). Follow my journey on the OLS program on this [blog](./blog/blog)

This README is based on the [STEMM Role Models](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels) example highlighted as good practice in the OLS call on community repository essential materials ([week 4](./call-notes-wk4-LicenceReadmeCoc.md)).

This README and project is a work-in-progress. The below are place holders.
