- https://www.cscce.org/resources/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-dei/

%**Zoom polls!!**

DEI tips sheets are practical guides that begin eith personal sotires describing a problem and conclude with refelection questions and practicle actions.

Tip 1: Childcare at Scientific meetings
- Checklist of items developed by people at SfN

Tip 2: Deconolizing international research collaborations
- %**This is situated openness**
- Kate Baker (Exeter) speaking on this. Talking about colonial legecies. Good to speak to about OHBM Symposium.
- Community managers are in a good position to change these things
- Tips sheet gives and overview of situation
- %**Reflection questions might be good for OHBM**

Tip 3: Inclusive Marketing
- A lot of us are managing a lot of content and marketing via newsletter etc.
- Do a regular content audit (e.g. social media). Quaterly audit to make sure it's representative of your community. Not just highlighting senior faculty etc., diversity of students.
- "Content that elivates diverse voices, diverse role modles and inclusive change"

Tip 4: Member recruitment
- %**Make sure your community is diverse. How to recruit a diverse community?!**
- Tip sheet discusses overburdening certain members of your community.

Breakout (Decolonising international research collaborations)
1. Introduce
2. Read tip sheet
3. Discussion questions

In our group:
- Abby Paulson (Community Manager with Science Talk, Project Coordinator with nitrc.org and sparc.science)


Developing trust can take a long time.
Collaboration can be very extractive. How to put it back within the community? Involve them a lot in the design process - co-developing. Need to be involved from the start.

Refelction questions
- How many local scietists are involved in collaboration or co-creation? Who have I got involved in my symposium?
- Are the local scientists involved in the decision making & are they authors on the published work?
- Who has access to and interprets the resulting datasets, and who applies the knowledges?


-%**I could do OHBM symposium in interview format?**

Inclusive event design

Indigenous co-creation
- Transformational objective, incremental step change (Allen Pope, Arctic Science). See: https://iasc.info/communications/news-archive/619-action-group-on-indigenous-involvement-delivers-recommendations-and-iasc-responds
- Nurturing relationships onto Institutional Boards
- Celebrate little wins, but acknowledge that there is a long way to go.
- Name the power structure
- Do not feature senior faculty in marketing materials. Feature students and senior faculty.

# Follow up with Kate Baker and Arielle Bennet-Lovell

- People are at different stages of the journey
- Biotropica, "Decolonising field research"
- First and last author is particularly problematic in internationally collaborative projects. Just group name.
- Issue of decolonising is being published in quite a few journals. Look at social sciences.
- Heating discussions around, but we're lacking on the next steps.
- Love story telling.
- 	"Do you have an experience of working with Western researchers? / Open Science?
- 	Start with people telling their stories. Especially funny one.
- 	**What does actual openness would look like to them? What do they need? What does it look like in and ideal world?**
- 	Solution focus. People switch off if they are just being told off. People afre more receptive
- 	Link with co-production. Whereever you're working, engage early. What issues are you facing, what is important to you. Right from the begining. dependsnt on trust. "To co produce or not co-produce". Ongoing collaboratrion. Takes money and time. Easy to say, but in order for it to happen you do know what's going to happen which makes it hard to write grant about it. So need to start with seed funding. Authorship models are really importnant. Not just european first and last.
- 	Guardian article on the ridiculous price of academic confernces. And location. The public should be involved in co-creation.
- Spheres of influence. You can only influence things which are directly around you. Simple things we can all do, expanding into the more complex stuff. e.g. making sure skype calls are moderated to make all voices heard.
- There will still be some people in our audience with their head in the sand.
- To get the best out of something, it needs to be developed slowly. Time to have the questions with people. In order for science to be inclusive needs to be slow! If you have other responsibilities, you can't go at speed!
- Naming some of the stuff which is out of control - you're notgoing to be able to solve interenet issues for people in some country because the state hasn't invested in it. What can you do?
- Cuban guy as feminist killjoy. Are people giving him the eyeroll? Listen to the feedback. There has to be a space to talk about it, without putting all the burden on one person/type.
- Any success stories? Ask to Malvika about OLS.
- To get people involved - do the research yourself and promote it out to those universities. Don't just say "anyone know anyone in the global south?". Proactive strategy. (Like getting a job - you research it, you don't wait/hope for a job to turn up). Inbound marketing. Translating stuff to support access via common languages.
- "If we really want to inlcude people, you have to do the work".
- We're so stuck in doing things in the same old ways. Know that we can find solutions. Solvable problem, with thought an enjinuity.
- Kate happy to listen to a rehersal. Can open the call to more of CSCCE.
- This is out of our comfort zone. it's ok to be nervous.
- **Platform - use your privilage. Your message is, "go and speak to these people yourself". Not, "Here, I've solved it". The aim is to start another conversation. **



# Follow up with Lou Woodley etc.

01//05/20
(Arielle, Kate Baker, Katie Pratt, Lou Woodley)

- **Make sure I speak to Louise from the Open Hardware stuff in Oxford.**
- Review: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Us9VI_Wonc0-OvrhoHe--d17XRMNXEb6ACRs6DSZBDk/edit. Is there anything they've missed? Anything to change?
