Taken while walking my dog walk this weekend. Beautiful pathetic fallacy - holding my energy against the incoming floods! ðŸ™ƒ

Establish a culture of gratitude ritual and try it. (2-3 minutes)

Examples: recognitions (recognize colleagues), sparkling moments (recognize community members), shout-outs

Review your overall goals and challenges faced in the last week in your project. (5 minutes)

Review your assignments, reflect on where in your project are they applicable. (10 minutes)


Review your GitHub repo and get any help you need adding your content developed through the assignment from last week (i.e. vision statement, open canvas, roadmap, community guideline, CoC etc.). (5-10 minutes)


Identify experts to invite to future mentor meetings (2-3 minutes).

Use these question to brainstorm this section: Do we need an expert at any stage? Which week they might likely be useful? Which area do we need expert advice?
