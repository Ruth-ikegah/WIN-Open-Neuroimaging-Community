# OLS Call Week 3

## Roll call
* Cass 
* Naomi


## Agenda
1. Establish a check-in ritual and try it. (2-3 minutes). Examples: weather check (my project feels like a blustery wind right now), .gif share, video share

Cass: Taken while walking my dog walk this weekend. Beautiful pathetic fallacy - holding my energy against the incoming floods! 🙃 (Renders in the [github repo](https://github.com/cassgvp/WIN-Open-Neuroimaging-Community/blob/master/OLS-Calls/Week3.md))

_**NP: <3** Is this peaceful?_ CGVP: **Super** peaceful ❤️

2. Establish a culture of gratitude ritual and try it. (2-3 minutes). Examples: recognitions (recognize colleagues), sparkling moments (recognize community members), shout-outs

N gratitude to C: TY for calendar

3. Review your overall goals and challenges faced in the last week in your project. (5 minutes)

* NP prompts: Cass's new [blog](https://github.com/cassgvp/WIN-Open-Neuroimaging-Community/blob/master/blog/blog.md) :star:. Prototyping has worked before, so seems sensible to use tools that work well for you & the first users during this prototyping stage == github? Q: who would be the next person to build on the event prototype you create?



4. Review your assignments, reflect on where in your project are they applicable. (10 minutes)

* Cass: So many thoughts [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BTnhgJgSrGeMk3BahN6SU8uvKzfxkbN53DEIPP1QZyw/edit?usp=sharing). 
* Starting to turn it into a [trello board](https://trello.com/b/u4FqvNJv/win-open-neuroimaging-hack)
* Working through [mozilla event tutorial](https://github.com/cassgvp/WIN-Open-Neuroimaging-Community/blob/master/OLS-MiniAssignments/mozilla-designing-an-open-event.md) looks useful. 
* Interesting to see that the first thing here is not a roadmap, but an event walk through, which is what I've done. 


5. Review your GitHub repo and get any help you need adding your content developed through the assignment from last week (i.e. vision statement, open canvas, roadmap, community guideline, CoC etc.). (5-10 minutes)

* Q: who will you design the event with and for? How will you communicate about the first event?
* Q: When could you run the first collab cafe? (assumption: start small, build trust & engagement ==> virtuous cycle. E.g. if you can engage people here, and demonstrate value, can this help with buy-in for whole hackday? Any downsides?)
* Q: How can you co-create the content programming with the audience & anyone who is permitting the researchers to spend the time at the event? (Who are these "anyone"?)


6. Identify experts to invite to future mentor meetings (2-3 minutes).

* Topic experts?
* Event facilitation experts?
* Work elsewhere: what could you adopt/reuse? what would you rather do from scratch? (NP prompts: Glasgow [editorial](https://elifesciences.org/articles/55543), cafe culture toolkit from Wellcome?)


7. Use these question to brainstorm this section: Do we need an expert at any stage? Which week they might likely be useful? Which area do we need expert advice?
